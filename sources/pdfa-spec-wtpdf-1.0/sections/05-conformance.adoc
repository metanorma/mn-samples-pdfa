== Conformance

=== Conformance levels

==== General

To address the key differences between requirements for accessibility, content
extraction, reflow and general reuse, this document defines conformance levels.

A file conforming with this document shall identify conformance with at least
one of the conformance levels defined in the following subclauses.

Conformance levels are not mutually exclusive. A file may conform to multiple
conformance levels.

As specified in the following subclauses, applicable conformance level(s) shall
be indicated using the appropriate PDF Declaration(s).

NOTE: The conformance levels defined in this document never specify requirements
that contradict the requirements of another conformance level in this document,
so it is always possible to conform to all conformance levels within the same
file.

==== Conformance level for reuse

A file declaring conformance with the conformance level for reuse shall conform to all the
general provisions of this document along with those identified as requirements for the
conformance level for reuse.

This document identifies requirements specific to the conformance level for
reuse by including *[Conformance level for reuse]* at the start of each
paragraph or clause containing that requirement. Such provisions are also
highlighted.

Files conforming to the conformance level for reuse shall include a PDF
Declaration with the URI identifier
`http://pdfa.org/declarations/wtpdf/#reuse1.0` as its `pdfd:conformsTo` entry.
The PDF Declaration may provide additional claim information using the
`pdfd:claimData` entry.

==== Conformance level for accessibility

A file declaring conformance with the conformance level for accessibility shall
conform to all the general provisions of this document along with those
identified as requirements for the conformance level for accessibility.

This document identifies requirements specific to the conformance level for
accessibility by including *[Conformance level for accessibility]* at the start
of each paragraph or clause containing that requirement. Such provisions are
also highlighted.

A file that conforms to this document and to the conformance level for
accessibility also meets all the requirements for ISO 14289-2 (PDF/UA-2) and, as
such, may include the PDF/UA identification schema (see <<annex-c>>) to indicate
its conformance with ISO 14289-2.

Files conforming to the conformance level for accessibility shall include a PDF
Declaration with the URI identifier
`http://pdfa.org/declarations/wtpdf/#accessibility1.0` as its `pdfd:conformsTo`
entry. The PDF Declaration may provide additional claim information using the
`pdfd:claimData` entry.

=== Conformance requirements

Beyond the requirements in this document, conformance with this document
requires that:

* a file shall adhere to all requirements of <<ISO_32000-2>>;

* a file shall adhere to all requirements of <<ISO_TS_32005>>;

* a file should not contain any feature that is deprecated in <<ISO_32000-2>>;

* a file may include any valid <<ISO_32000-2>> feature that is not explicitly
forbidden by this document;

* a file should not contain features described in specifications prior to
<<ISO_32000-2>> which are not explicitly defined or identified in
<<ISO_32000-2>>, <<ISO_TS_32005>> or this document.

*[Conformance level for accessibility]* â€” an embedded file, if necessary to the
understanding of the containing file, shall be accessible according to
objectively verifiable standards, e.g., <<W3C-wcag>>. If such an embedded file is
a PDF file, it shall conform to <<ISO_14289_all>> and/or to this document's conformance
level for accessibility.

NOTE: Embedded files referenced from the containing file, for use by a human
reader, can be necessary to the understanding of the document. See
<<file-format-embedded-files>>.

NOTE: Discouraging deprecated features aligns this document with <<ISO_19005-4>>.

NOTE: Conformance with <<ISO_TS_32005>> is required because, although <<ISO_32000-2>>
did not deprecate any structure types defined in PDF 1.7, <<ISO_32000-2:2020>>,
Annex L provided containment rules only for structure types defined in the PDF
2.0 namespace. <<ISO_TS_32005>> expands these containment rules to cover both the
PDF 2.0 namespace and those elements unique to the PDF 1.7 namespace. By
adhering to the requirements of <<ISO_TS_32005>> it is possible to include both PDF
2.0 and PDF 1.7 structure types in files that conform to this document.

A file may declare its support for, and conformity with, PDF extensions to
<<ISO_32000-2>> by use of an Extensions dictionary, as specified in ISO
32000-2:2020, 7.12.

NOTE: Use of extensions can potentially negatively impact accessibility,
compatibility and consistency of files when consumed by different processors.

Although other accessibility standards provide guidance for accessible content,
this document deliberately avoids requirements related to content. Conformity to
this document alone does not ensure that the content of a file is accessible.
Examples of cases not covered by this document include:

* where authors have used colour or contrast in an inaccessible manner;

* where ECMAScript present in the file can generate inaccessible results;

* where text content is potentially inaccessible to those with certain cognitive
impairments;

* whether a particular content item is real content or artifact content.

NOTE: Requirements governing author's creative choices, (e.g. requirements for
plain language), or the use of specific degrees of colour-contrast, are out of
scope for this document. For such requirements, authors can refer to <<W3C-wcag>>
and other applicable standards such as <<ISO_24495-1>>.
