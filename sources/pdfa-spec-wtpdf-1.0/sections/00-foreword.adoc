.Foreword

The PDF Association was formed with the primary intent of developing and
promoting the use of the Portable Document Format (PDF) for the benefit of
content creators and consumers worldwide.

The PDF Association is a membership-based organization that brings together
implementers, solution providers, and users to advance the capabilities of PDF
technology. The Association develops technical specifications, best practices,
and educational resources to ensure PDF remains a robust, accessible, and
interoperable format.

This specification was developed by the PDF Reuse Technical Working Group (TWG)
and the PDF/UA Technical Working Group (TWG) of the PDF Association. These
working groups comprise experts from various industries including software
development, accessibility, publishing, and document management.

The PDF Association acknowledges the contributions of all working group members
and the broader PDF community in the development of this specification.
