== Established PDF Declarations

=== General

A list of industry-agreed PDF Declarations is published by the PDF Association at: https://pdfa.org/declarations/

=== Additional Declarations

The PDF Association's list is not exhaustive. Authors may define any PDF Declaration, but only PDF Declarations that appear on https://pdfa.org/declarations/ are likely to be application-independent.
