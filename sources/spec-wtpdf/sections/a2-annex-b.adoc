=== Standard layout attributes

inline-level structure element (ILSE) types in accordance with ISO 32000-2:2020,
Tables 377 and 378 are provided in <<table-b-1>>.

[cols="1,1,3a"]
|===
| Structure elements | Attribute | Examples

.8+| Any structure element

|Placement
|A *Figure* that is a child of a *P* has a default *Placement* value of
_Inline_. If a *Figure* breaks the flow of the paragraph's block, the
*Placement* value is explicitly set to _Block_ to be semantically
correct.

|Writing Mode
|Text written from right to left.

|BackgroundColor
| Background colour of a *TD* structure element identifying a group of cells.

|BorderColor
| The border of a box in which the box's appearance denotes the significance of
the content (such as an alert).

|BorderStyle
| Lines used to represent relationships in an organization chart.

|BorderThickness
| A table cell where thicker lines are used to denote that the cell contains a
summation of other cells' values.

|Padding
| Spacing around text columns to disambiguate the columns.

|Color
| Use of colour in a chart legend.

Examples of semantic significance for standard layout attributes for block-level structure
element (BLSE) types in accordance with ISO 32000-2:2020, Tables 377 and 379 are described in
<<table-b-2>>.

.3+| *Figure, Form, Formula and Table* elements

| BBox
| A formula that lies on a single page and occupies a single rectangle.

NOTE: When present, the rectangle defined by the BBox encloses all of the
element's visible content.

NOTE: Current-generation assistive technology often relies on this attribute.

|Width
|A form using a certain amount of space to allow for input.

|Height
|Two figures with different-sized content are represented with the same height
on the page.

.6+|
*TH* (Table header);
*TD* (Table data)

|Width
|
* A table cell whose width is important and differs from the
content width.
* A header cell (TH) that should have a specific width, but whose
content is much smaller.
* An empty cell that maintains a certain width, contributing to the
layout.

|Height
|A set of table cells of consistent height but containing addresses of
three or four lines.

|BlockAlign
|A table cell in which alignment denotes a totalling or other
meaning.

|InlineAlign
|A table cell containing a right-aligned number indicating that the
cell contains the total of the values in the cells above it.

|TBorderStyle
|A table cell with a specific border styling indicating that the cell
contains the total of the values in the cells above it.

|TPadding
|A table cell with specific padding indicating that the cell contains
the total of the values in the cells above it.

Examples of semantic significance for standard layout attributes for inline-level structure
element (ILSE) types in accordance with ISO 32000-2:2020, Tables 377 and Table 380 are
described in <<table-b-3>>.

| Structure elements | Attribute | Examples

.6+|
Any ILSE; BLSEs containing ILSEs or containing direct or nested content items

|BaselineShift
|To allow the LATEX logo to be used in reflow applications,
the *BaselineShift* for the "a" and "e" is specified.

|LineHeight
|(No semantic intent identified)

|TextPosition
|An ordinal suffix such as 21st has the *TextPosition* value of _Sup_.

|TextDecorationColor
|Text decorations such as strikeouts and carets that are colour-coded by author.

|TextDecorationThickness
|(No semantic intent identified)

|TextDecorationType
|Text to be struck from the document has the attribute with
a value of _LineThrough_.

.2+|*RB, RT, RP*

|RubyAlign
|(no semantic intent identified)

|RubyPosition
|Some authors vary ruby positioning conventions to
disambiguate between different kinds of ruby annotation
within the same document. The RubyPosition attribute can
be used to preserve that semantic intent.

|Any structure element containing text whose inline- progression direction is
top to bottom or bottom to top.

|GlyphOrientationVertical
|The preferred orientation of alphabetic (non-ideographic)
text within a vertically typeset Japanese document content
can depend on what that text represents. In this context,
initialisms like "PDF" are usually set with an orientation
angle of 0, while the expanded form "Portable Document
Format" is rotated 90 degrees.

Examples of semantic significance for standard layout attributes specific to content in columns
(see ISO 32000-2:2020, Tables 377 and 381) are described in <<table-b-4>>.

=== Standard list attributes

Examples of semantic significance for standard list attributes (see ISO
32000-2:2020, Table 382) are described in <<table-b-5>>.

NOTE: Structure types for lists have special requirements for attributes, see <<file-format-list>>.

| Attribute | Examples

|ListNumbering
|A list that uses decimal Arabic numerals as labels has the attribute's value
set to _Decimal_.

|ContinuedList
|For a semantic list whose items are separated into two lists due to other
content in between list-items, the second list's *L* structure element, has the
attribute present and set to _true_.

|ContinuedFrom
|For a semantic list whose items are separated into two lists due to other
content in between list-items, the second list's *L* structure element, has the
attribute present and identifies the first list as the one it continues from.

|Desc
|For page content representing a non-interactive form field whose purpose is not
clear from the content has an attribute value describing the context of the
content.
