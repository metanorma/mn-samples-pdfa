== From a PDF file format perspective (normative)

This section provides a technical description of the EA-PDF v1 file format for
readers familiar with the technical details of PDF and PDF/A. This section contains
requirements that match those described in the previous sections. However, many
aspects discussed above do not lead to formal requirements as they are either covered
by existing PDF/A requirements or recommendations, or are explanations for EA-PDF
developers or end-users.

All "SHALL" mandatory requirements are worded to ensure that they are entirely
machine-validatable. It is assumed that EA-PDF validators do [underline]#_not_#
need to parse any original source raw email assets for validation but can parse
only PDF data (including content streams) and XMP Metadata to perform all validation
defined in this document.

Not every PDF feature is listed: if a PDF feature is not mentioned and is not otherwise
constrained by PDF/A, then it may occur in an EA-PDF file. This applies to many
PDF features which do not impact the reliable rendering of pages in PDF/A.

Boilerplate and common wording found in PDF ISO subset standards has been intentionally
omitted from this section so that the focus can be on EA-PDF-specific requirements.
Requirements from PDF/A are not duplicated here since all EA-PDF files are always
conforming PDF/A-3 or PDF/A-4 files.

Except for Collection Schema keys, all other PDF key names introduced by EA-PDF
start with the registered developer prefix "Mail" and followed by an underscore
to clearly identify them (i.e. "/Mail_â€¦").

NOTE: technically this is unnecessary in certain situations (such as keys inside
new dictionaries), however it can be helpful if non-EA-PDF aware software modifies
an EA-PDF file, if pages or content are extracted, etc.

=== EA-PDF file

The PDF header SHALL be either "%PDF-1.7" or "%PDF-2.0" and the declared PDF version
number of an EA-PDF file SHALL be either PDF 1.7 or PDF 2.0.

NOTE: the above PDF version requirement accounts for the Document catalog *Version*
key (if present) and file header.

All EA-PDF files SHALL conform to either PDF/A-3a, PDF/A-3u, PDF/A-4, PDF/A-4f,
or PDF/A-4e.

NOTE: the above requirements for PDF/A conformance incorporate a lot of technical
requirements.

All EA-PDF files that also conform to PDF/A-3 SHALL have a Document Information
dictionary referenced from the trailer *Info* entry. The information in this document
information dictionary SHALL be consistent with the document catalog XMP Metadata
entry as defined by <<table-07>> in <<PDF_A_3>>.

NOTE: Reason: because PDF 2.0 has deprecated document information dictionaries,
it is an intentional EA-PDF design decision to not extend the document information
dictionary with custom keys to express email-specific information. Document-level
XMP metadata is where all EA-PDF definitive metadata information is located. However,
the prohibition of a document information dictionary in PDF/A-4 files raises compatibility
with a wide range of legacy software that do not support XMP.

All EA-PDF files SHALL NOT contain a *PieceInfo* entry in the document catalog
dictionary.

NOTE: excluding the use of document catalog *PieceInfo* private data is not viewed
as an issue, since Associated Files, 2^nd^ class keys, or page-based *PieceInfo*
private data can all be used as alternatives for storing private data. This exclusion
ensures that a partial document information dictionary (i.e. only containing a
ModDate) is then never present in PDF/A-4 based EA-PDF files, which may otherwise
be confusing in legacy viewers that do not understand XMP.

The XMP *pdf:Keywords* property and, for all PDF-A/3-based EA-PDF files, the PDF
document information dictionary *Keywords* entry SHALL each include "EA-PDF".

NOTE: Reason: standardized inclusion of the term "EA-PDF" in both the Document
Information dictionary and equivalent XMP ensures that EA-PDF users using non-EA-PDF
aware legacy software have easy access to see if a PDF file is EA-PDF (since XMP
data is not always presented). This is machine validatable.

For `PDF/mail-1{s, si}` with no email attachments, the Document Catalog dictionary's
*PageMode* entry SHALL be _UseOutlines_ and the Viewer Preferences *NonFullScreenPageMode*
entry SHALL be _UseOutlines_.

For `PDF/mail-1{s, si}` with email attachments, the Document Catalog *PageMode*
entry SHALL be _UseAttachments_ and the Viewer Preferences *NonFullScreenPageMode*
entry SHALL be _UseAttachments_ for PDF 2.0 or _UseOutlines_ for PDF 1.7 files.

For `PDF/mail-1{m, mi}`, the Document Catalog *PageMode* entry SHALL be _UseOutlines_
and the Viewer Preferences *NonFullScreenPageMode* entry SHALL be _UseOutlines_.

For `PDF/mail-1{c, ci}`, the Document Catalog *PageMode* entry SHALL be _UseAttachments_
and the Viewer Preferences *NonFullScreenPageMode* entry SHALL be _UseAttachments_.

All `PDF/mail-1` files SHALL set the Viewer Preferences *DisplayDocTitle* entry
to _true_.

NOTE: Reason: this tries to ensure that the PDF title metadata is always used in
window title bar of viewers.

For non-isolated `PDF/mail-1{s, m, c}`, the Document Catalog dictionary SHALL have
an *AF* entry as an array with at least one array element. At least one array element
(file specification dictionary) in this array SHALL have an *AFRelationship* value
of _Source_, representing the primary original source email asset(s). If the original
email asset comprises a set of files footnote:[A "set of files" is differentiated
from multiple original source email assets. A "set" is where several files are
needed to function.], then either:

. a PDF Related Files (*RF* entry) SHALL be in the file specification dictionary
of the primary original email asset; or
. additional Associated Files SHALL be listed in the Document Catalog *AF* entry,
each with an *AFRelationship* value of _Supplement_.

All `PDF/mail-1` files SHALL have an *Outlines* and *DPartRoot* entries in the
Document Catalog. As a consequence, all pages in all EA-PDF files will have a *DPart*
entry.

NOTE: Reason: this ensures both PDF document navigation functionality and structured
information, which can both be used in validating EA-PDF files.

=== Content sets

For the purposes of EA-PDF validation, a blank PDF page is a page without any visible
text, visible image, or visible vector as page content or annotations within the
page *CropBox* that would result in one or more pixels being painted.

NOTE: if *CropBox* is not present, it inherits the value from the *MediaBox*.

NOTE: this technical definition for visible is not infallible -- a page that marks
a single pixel that is white passes this test but will not normally be visible
in a viewing application. It is assumed that all EA-PDF Creation Software is well
intentioned.

NOTE: the requirements below are worded such that machine-validation can check
consistency between XMP metadata, PDF content streams, navigation data, and other
PDF data structures without referring to the original source email assets. This
assumes EA-PDF validators can parse both PDF and XMP data, which is not unreasonable
for PDF/A validators. It is not necessary for a human to perceive the page content
to perform EA-PDF validation or to parse source email formats.

All `PDF/mail-1` files SHALL contain at least one _Content Set_ of at least 1 page
each that SHALL NOT be blank footnote:[This requirement is intentionally not narrowed
to be the rendering of email headers or of an email body as a zero-length source
email asset or a source email asset with no valid emails may also need preserving.].
The first page in each _Content Set_ in all `PDF/mail-1` files SHALL be referenced
from at least one Outline item referenced from the Document Catalog *Outlines*
entry.

NOTE: Reason: this ensures a basic functional PDF with bookmark (outline) navigation
even when the email is empty (e.g., an empty draft).

NOTE: the form of the outline destination used is not further defined, while still
allowing the page to be validated. This is also because logical structure is not
mandated in EA-PDF.

`PDF/mail-1{s, si}` files SHALL represent only a single email that is the only
email referenced in the document-level (document catalog) XMP metadata stream.

`PDF/mail-1{m, mi}` files SHALL represent 2 or more emails and SHALL contain a
_Content Set_ for each email that SHALL NOT be blank. As a result, a
`PDF/mail-1{m, mi}` file SHALL contain at least 2 pages that are not blank.
Each email SHALL be included in the document-level (document catalog) XMP metadata
stream.

NOTE: Reason: a requirement such as "`PDF/mail-1{c,ci}` container PDF files SHALL
NOT contain any PDF pages that represent the content of an email" is not machine
validatable and is thus not stated. Validation is thus limited to outlines (bookmarks),
logical structure, and document part metadata (DPM).

EA-PDF files may also contain additional _Content Sets_ at the discretion of the
EA-PDF Creation Software and subject to other requirements, such as:

* multiple renderings of the email bodies;
* a list of email attachments;
* PDF/A renderings of email attachments;
* a comprehensive rendering of all email headers;
* a "raw dump" of the email as a "source code" style text listing of RFC 822 email;
* conversion reports;
* additional rendered or embedded information (e.g., policy settings, etc.).

The first page of every _Content Set_ SHALL be referenced by an outline item in
the same PDF. Other outline items in the PDF to locations within _Content Sets_
may also be present. As a result, all EA-PDF files will have at least one outline
item, and the number of outline items will be greater than or equal to the number
of _Content Sets_.

All pages in all `PDF/mail-1` files SHALL be included in the Document Part Metadata,
referenced by the Document Catalog *DPartRoot* entry.

NOTE: technically the above requirement is already covered by the previous requirement
to have a *DPartRoot* entry in the Document Catalog and the existing ISO 32000-2
requirement to include all pages in DPM.

This document does not otherwise prescribe how _Content Sets_ are organized or
how emails are rendered to PDF pages.

=== PDF page content

PDF/A standards define requirements for ensuring device independent page content
streams and rendering of pages in EA-PDF files. The DPM data, outlines and logical
structure can be used by validation software to check some of these requirements.

Content (including email bodies and all header fields) that is text in the source
email assets SHOULD use PDF text objects.

NOTE: Reason: this recommends that email content (including headers) that is text
is retained as text so that software can search the content of emails. Text render
mode 3 is acceptable. Note that if an email contains an image of text, then there
is no requirement for that text to be OCR-ed.

NOTE: this cannot be validated without referencing the original source email asset(s)
and is thus only a recommendation.

All _Core Fields_ and their values (when present) SHALL use text objects.

NOTE: Reason: this ensures that most legacy software will be to search for the
basic email core field information relevant to humans. Text render mode 3 is acceptable.
Due to the inclusion of required logical structure (see below) this can also be
machine validated (a PDF text object is demarcated by the *BT* and *ET* operators).

Each email attachment (as indicated in the document-level XMP metadata) SHALL be
visibly represented by a File Attachment annotation positioned entirely within
the *CropBox* of a PDF page in each _Content Set_ that represents an email body
of the source email that contained that attachment (as determined by DPM -- see below).

NOTE: if *CropBox* is not present, it inherits the value from the *MediaBox*.

[example]
if an email has 1 attachment with 2 bodies (HTML and plain text) then there will
be at least 2 file attachment annotations -- at least one on a page (Content Set)
associated with HTML rendering and a separate annotation on a different page (Content
Set) associated with the plain text body. There is no requirement that the file
attachment annotation is always on the first page of the Content Set, although
this is conventional. Note that for efficiency both annotations could refer to
the same file specification dictionary and thus the same embedded file stream.
Furthermore, both annotations can also share the same appearance stream (e.g.,
XObject of a paperclip). Additional PDF file attachment annotations may also be
added by the EA-PDF creation software.

NOTE: this requirement does not constrain how email attachments in other Content
Sets (such as an index of email attachments) might be represented.

All pages in an EA-PDF file SHOULD have a unique page number or other identifying
context as part of the page content. Such context SHOULD use PDF text objects.

NOTE: Reason: this tries to ensure that extracted pages retain some basic context
information. It is not a requirement as it cannot be machine validated -- however
if additional logical structure requirements were mandated then PDF text object
(*BT*/*ET*) validation might be possible, but this was viewed as onerous.

PDF/A always requires the use of device-independent color such as via CIE-based
color spaces (<<ISO_32000_2,clause=8.6.5>>). For unspecified color content in email,
sRGB SHOULD be assumed.

NOTE: Reason: sRGB is the de facto color space of the web, but modern HTML/CSS
permits more advanced color spaces. It is unknown if these are (or will be) supported
in emails, hence EA-PDF does not place any constraints. The preservation policy
may also constrain email conversion to monochrome PDFs (for example).

NOTE: EA-PDF Writer: many legacy PDF viewers are not "PDF/A conforming processors"
and do not support Output Intents (<<ISO_32000_2,clause=14.11.5>>) while others
do not appear to support Default color spaces (<<ISO_32000_2,clause=8.6.5.6>>)
which are common methods utilized by PDF/A files to ensure device-independent color.
By using CIE-Based color spaces directly with content streams, such viewer limitations
can be overcome.

NOTE: EA-PDF Writer: A PDF *CalRGB* color space may be used to [underline]#approximate#
sRGB, however various "Tiny sRGB" ICC profiles exist which are very small
(stem:[~0.5 "unitsml(kbyte_B)"]). Because of object reuse in PDF, the sRGB definition
need only occur once in each `PDF/mail` file.

NOTE: it cannot be assumed that email is always RGB-based, or that pure text emails
are pure black & white. Many email clients do not display plain text emails as
pure black so there is no requirement in EA-PDF that plain text emails must be
rendered as pure black in a single channel color space. The use of CIE-based color
spaces for plain text emails are all suitable as they are all device independent
and meet PDF/A requirements.

NOTE: EA-PDF Writer: PDF graphic state defaults are black content on an assumed
white background. EA-PDF Creation Software does not need to unnecessarily paint
white content as a background.

NOTE: EA-PDF Writer: if page content stream creation cannot be suitably configured,
device independent color in PDF can be achieved using a default color space resources
or via PDF output intents at the file level or page-level if PDF 2.0, however several
legacy viewers do not appear to support output intents.

Emails with URLs that are intended to be actionable by users or software SHOULD
use PDF Link annotations.

NOTE: Reason: this link requirement cannot be validated without additionally parsing
the original source (raw) email assets and understanding the policy environment.
This is viewed as onerous for validators and not possible for `PDF/mail-1{c, ci}`
so it is stated as a recommendation and not a requirement.

If referenced assets (e.g. file attachments; embedded images) from the source emails
needed for page rendering are also being individually preserved (e.g., based on
a policy setting), then those referenced assets SHOULD be embedded as Associated
Files (*AF* array) with an *AFRelationship* of _Source._ They SHOULD be associated
with the most appropriate PDF object (e.g., an Image XObject for images, a Form
XObject for SVG vector art, a Font dictionary for font-related data, etc.) Refer
to <<AssociatedFiles>>.

NOTE: Reason: these requirements cannot be validated without additionally parsing
the original source (raw) email assets. This is viewed as onerous for validators
and not possible for isolated EA-PDF files so they are stated as recommendations
and not requirements. It is also not possible to enumerate every possibility and
every object to make the above a requirement in all cases.

=== Embedded files

All embedded file streams included as Associated Files (i.e. referenced from an
*AF* array entry or AF tag in a marked content sequence) SHALL be listed in the
Document Catalog *Name* name-tree *EmbeddedFiles* entry.

NOTE: a lot of legacy software relies on the *EmbeddedFiles* name-tree to provide
basic access to embedded files, while other legacy software may also additionally
add file attachment annotations and remove duplicate embedded files. This legacy
experience is further constrained as it provides a simple flat list of embedded
files using their filename. This can be machine validated.

PDF file specification strings SHALL NOT include absolute or relative path components
(i.e., REVERSE SOLIDUS and two PERIODs SHALL NOT be present).

All embedded file streams SHALL have a *Subtype* key in their embedded file stream
dictionary which is the IANA Media (MIME) Type of the file and SHALL match the
equivalent document-level (document catalog) XMP metadata. This SHALL NOT include
any SEMI-COLONs or IANA Media Type parameters. Where the embedded file originates
in a source email asset that also specifies IANA Media Type parameters, the same
Media Type parameters SHALL be set as the value of the *Mail_MediaTypeParameters*
key (PDF string object).

To reconstruct an email IANA Media Type including parameters the following algorithm
SHALL be used:

. convert the *Subtype* entry (PDF name object) to a UTF-8 equivalent string value
as defined in ISO 32000-2, Annex J.3.4;
. append a SEMI-COLON;
. append the *Mail_MediaTypeParameters* entry text string (if present) while accounting
for any encoding differences (such as UTF-16BE).

Use of generic Media Types (such as text/plain, application/octet-stream, or similar)
SHOULD be avoided.

NOTE: Reason: these Media Type requirements cannot be validated without additionally
parsing the original source (raw) email assets. This is viewed as onerous for validators
and not possible for `PDF/mail-1{c, ci}` so they are stated as recommendations
and not requirements.

Non-isolated `PDF/mail-1{s, m}` files SHALL embed the original raw source email
asset (e.g., EML, MSG, MBOX, OST/PST, etc.) in the Document Catalog Associated
File (*AF*) array with array elements referring to an embedded file specification
dictionary with an *AFRelationship* entry of _Source_. There SHALL only be at least
one such entry in this *AF* array.

The document-level (document catalog) XMP metadata for source email asset containers
SHALL match for file size and IANA Media Type.

NOTE: the XMP Metadata for source email asset container filenames permits the use
of absolute and relative paths as well as platform specific components, which is
not supported by PDF file specification dictionaries and thus no requirement is
specified.

If additional source email assets are required as part of a source email asset
file set, then those files can either be added to the Document Catalog Associated
File (*AF*) array with array elements referring to file specification dictionaries
with an *AFRelationship* value of _Supplement_, or added as a Related Files array
(*RF* entry) of the primary original raw source email asset embedded file specification
dictionary (which has an *AFRelationship* value of _Source)_.

NOTE: EA-Writers: PDF lossless compression such as FLATE is recommended for all
embedded data streams. If the raw data format is already highly compressed, then
the size may grow very slightly.

NOTE: EA-Readers: for file sets, EA-PDF processors ought to support both the Associated
Files_ Source _with one or more_ Supplement _form, as well as the Related Files
array form to ensure that any original source email "file sets" always get extracted
as a holistic functional set.

_EA-PDF Writers_ SHOULD add the MD5 checksum and uncompressed size of all embedded
files in the embedded file parameter dictionary *CheckSum* and *Size* entries
(see <<ISO_32000_2,table=45>>).

=== PDF Collections (`PDF/mail-1{c,ci}`)

The Document Catalog dictionary of all `PDF/mail-1{c, ci}` files SHALL have a
*Collections* entry. The *Collections* entry SHALL NOT be present in all other
`PDF/mail-1{s, si, m, mi}` files.

`PDF/mail-1{c, ci}` files that are PDF version 1.7 SHALL have an Extensions Dictionary
indicating Adobe (*ADBE*) Extension Level 5 with entries *BaseVersion* /1.7
(PDF name object) and *ExtensionLevel* 5, as specified in "_Adobe(R) Supplement
to ISO 32000-1 BaseVersion: 1.7 ExtensionLevel: 5 (Adobe(R) Acrobat(R) SDK, Version
9.1)_", dated June 2009 <<ADBE_Extn_L5>>.

The Collection dictionary *D* entry SHALL NOT be present. The Collection dictionary
*View* entry SHALL NOT have the value _H_.

NOTE: Reason: these requirements prohibit opening a specified file in the collection
as the default view. EA-PDF relies on opening the [underline]#container PDF# which
is what ISO 32000 specifies will happen if the *D* entry is not present.

If the Collection dictionary contains a *Navigator* entry, it SHALL NOT have either
*SWF* or *APIVersion* entries.

NOTE: Reason: this prohibits vendor-specific support that was not adopted by ISO.

All folder and filenames used in `PDF/mail-1{c,ci}` files SHALL conform to the
valid file name restrictions and SHALL be unique after case normalization, as described
below Table 159 in <<ISO_32000_2>>.

All `PDF/mail-1{c, ci}` files SHALL have a *Schema* entry in the Collections dictionary.
The following custom fields representing the _Core Fields_ SHALL all exist in the
collection schema dictionary -- additional custom fields can also be present:

[[table-06]]
.required Collection custom field names and subtypes for Core Fields (`PDF/mail-1{c, ci}`)
[cols="a,a",options="header"]
|===
| Key name in Collection Schema | CustomField Subtype

| To | S (string)
| From | S (string)
| Sent | D (date)
| Subject | S (string)
| `Message-ID`
footnote:[Note that this is the email's `Message-ID` (which may not exist) and
is not the synthetically generated `Mail_GUID` used internally.]
| S (string)
| Cc | S (string)
| Bcc | S (string)
| Size | Size
| Attachments | N (number)

|===

If the *E* entry is present in any Collection *CustomField* dictionary it SHALL
have the value _false_.

NOTE: Reason: this prohibits accidental editing of the CustomField data.

EA-PDF does not further constrain the textual field name presented in the PDF viewer
(*N* entry), field ordering (*O* entry), or default visibility (*V* entry) in the
Collection schema, or the use of the Collection Sort or Folder dictionaries.

=== Document part metadata (DPM)

All EA-PDF files SHALL define document part metadata for all pages via the Document
Catalog *DPartRoot* dictionary entry.

NOTE: consequently, this also requires every page in all EA-PDF files to always
have a *DPart* entry.

NOTE: Reason: requiring DPM allows additional machine validation of EA-PDF files
without needing to process original source email asset file formats, as well as
offering richer presentation options in EA-PDF aware software.

All custom EA-PDF keys used in DPM SHALL use the registered prefix "Mail" followed
by an underscore: "Mail_".

NOTE: some of the same key names introduced for DPM are also used for Logical Structure.

[[figure-12]]
.DPart hierarchy for example showing PDF object numbers
image::figure-12.png[]

Intermediate nodes of the Document Part Metadata tree SHALL be used to associate
emails with all _Content Sets_ associated with that email, as illustrated by the
green nodes (middle column of cells) in <<figure-08>>. These intermediate nodes
SHALL contain a *DPM* dictionary as specified in <<table-07>> below.

[[table-07]]
.Entries in an EA-PDF *DPM* dictionary for an intermediate node associated with an email
[cols="a,a,a",options="header"]
|===
| Key | Type | Description

| *Mail_MessageID* | text string | Optional. The `Message-ID` from the header of
the email and that SHALL match a pdfmailmeta:messageidin the document-level XMP
metadata.

NOTE: the `Message-ID` email header is optional according to <<RFC_822>>, but is
extremely common and widely supported with email aware software.

| *Mail_GUID* | text string

| *Required*. A GUID that SHALL match a `pdfmailmeta:Mail_GUID` property in the
EA-PDF XMP metadata.

If *Mail_MessageID* is also present, then *Mail_GUID* takes precedence in identifying
the email. Matching SHALL be performed according to <<ISO_32000_2,annex=J.3.3>>.

|===

`PDF/mail-1{s, si}` files SHALL have exactly one intermediate node in the Document
Part Metadata tree with *Mail_MessageID* / *Mail_GUID* entries.

`PDF/mail-1{m, mi}` files SHALL have at least 2 intermediate nodes in the Document
Part Metadata tree with *Mail_MessageID* / *Mail_GUID* entries.

`PDF/mail-1{c, ci}` files SHALL have no nodes in the Document Part Metadata tree
with *Mail_MessageID* or *Mail_GUID* entries.

Every *Mail_MessageID* and *Mail_GUID* value SHALL match a corresponding property
in the Document Catalog XMP metadata stream.

All leaf nodes of the Document Part Metadata tree SHALL contain a *DPM* dictionary
to associate pages derived from a single email message with _Content Sets_ as illustrated
by the blue nodes (right most column of boxes) in <<figure-08>> as defined in <<table-08>>.

[[table-08]]

|===
| Key | Type | Description

| *Mail_ContentSetType*
| name
| _Required_. The _Content Set_ that all pages in the page range defined between
*Start* and *End* (inclusive) of the DPart dictionary represent. Supported values
are as follows (other values may be present):

* _AttachmentList_ -- a full list of all email attachments in the EA-PDF file. SHALL
NOT occur in `PDF/mail-1{c, ci}` files.
* _AttachmentRendering --_ see also*Subtype* entry, which SHALL be the Media Type
of the original email attachment. SHALL NOT occur in `PDF/mail-1{c, ci}` files.
* _BodyRendering_ -- an email body. See also *Subtype* entry which SHALL be the
Media Type of the email body. SHALL NOT occur in `PDF/mail-1{c, ci}` files.
* _ConversionReport_
* _EmailHeaderRendering_ -- a separate rendering of some or all of the email headers.
SHALL NOT occur in `PDF/mail-1{c, ci}` files.
* _FrontMatter_ - SHALL always occur in a `PDF/mail-1{c, ci}` file, optional in
other profiles.
* _PolicySettings_
* _Provenance_
* _RawEmailRendering_ -- the rendering of some or all of the original source "raw"
email.SHALL NOT occur in `PDF/mail-1{c, ci}` files.
* _Other_ -- unspecified

| *Mail_Subtype* | name | _Required_ if *ContentSetType* is _BodyRendering_ or
_AttachmentRendering._ Not required otherwise. Indicates the source Media Type
and any parameters of the rendered _Content Set_.The value of this entry SHALL
conform to the Media Type names defined in Internet RFC 2046, with the provision
that characters not permitted in names SHALL use the 2-character hexadecimal code
format described in <<ISO_32000_2,clause=7.3.5>>.

NOTE: this is the same type and definition used by the embedded file stream dictionary
*Subtype* entry (see <<ISO_32000_2,table=44>>).
| *Mail_Desc* | text string | _Required_. A human readable text string that describes
this _Content Set_ that might be presented in the UI of EA-PDF viewers when using
DPM.

=== Logical structure

EA-PDF Creation Software may utilize Tagged PDF and Logical Structure to provide
enhanced semantics with improved accessibility and reuse of extracted content.
EA-PDF defines an optional custom EA-PDF tag-set with specific rolemapping back
to the PDF 1.7 standard structure tag set.

NOTE: Reason: very few PDF applications appear to process custom PDF tag sets or
utilize tagging at all (although adoption is increasing). At the time of writing,
the burden of creation for tagging and custom-tagging is left as a design choice
for EA-PDF Creation Software. Future `PDF/mail` specifications may mandate the
use of a custom EA-PDF tag set.

NOTE: in this section the word "tag" is used as an informal term for "custom structure
element" although it is somewhat ambiguous with the tag operand of certain marked
content operators. Where the marked content operators are discussed, the italic
term "tag" specifically refers to that operand.

_EA-PDF Creation Software_ SHOULD create equivalent PDF logical structure to that
already present in original source email content (such as encoded in HTML email
bodies).

NOTE: Reason: many logical structure requirements cannot be validated without additionally
parsing the original source (raw) email assets. This is viewed as onerous for validators
and not possible for isolated EA-PDF files, so they are stated as recommendations
and not requirements.

_EA-PDF Creation Software_ SHOULD create PDF logical structure and use Tagged PDF
for the content of all pages in custom _Content Sets_ that are included in EA-PDF
files.

NOTE: Reason: use of logical structure and Tagged PDF ensures both reuse and accessibility
of custom content.

When PDF 2.0 (PDF/A-4) is used, `PDF/mail-1` files with logical structure SHALL
also conform to ISO TS 32005 and SHALL include the PDF Declaration for ISO TS 32005
in the document level XMP metadata (see https://pdfa.org/declarations/#ISO_TS_32005
and <<PDF_Declarations>>).

NOTE: Reason: ISO TS 32005 standardizes the set of inclusion rules for the
PDF 1.7 tag set, ensuring improved consistent behavior for reuse and accessibility
across processors.

For all `PDF/mail-1` files that contain Logical Structure, the logical structure
tree root structure element as defined by the *K* entry of the structure tree root
SHALL be a single structure element dictionary of structure type _Document_. If
an array type for the *K* entry of the structure tree root is used, it SHALL have
a single array element which SHALL be the structure type _Document_.

In all PDF/A-4 files with logical structure, the custom EA-PDF-defined semantics
SHALL be included using a PDF 2.0 Namespace dictionary with an *NS* entry of
_https://pdfa.org/ns/eaâ€‘pdf/mailâ€‘1_ and including a *RoleMapNS* entry, as shown
in <<example-02>> above. The following RoleMap SHALL also be included (additional
rolemappings may also be included).

[[table-09]]
.PDF 2.0 to PDF 1.7 backward compatibility role map
[cols="a,a",options="header"]
|===
| PDF 2.0 unique tags | Compatible PDF 1.7 tag

| Artifact | Private
| Aside | Div
| DocumentFragment | Div
| Em | Span
| FENote | Note
| H_n when stem:[n >= 7] | P
| Strong | Span
| Sub | Div
| Title | H1 _or_ P

|===

[NOTE,keep-separate=true]
====
Reason: this RoleMap will be ignored by all PDF 2.0 processors for structure elements
with an explicit namespace (*NS* entry), such as those defined by EA-PDF. However,
PDF 1.7 only processors reading a PDF 2.0 EA-PDF file containing this RoleMap will
use it to create a standard backward-compatible mapping to PDF 1.7 tags
(since PDF 1.7 only processors do not support PDF 2.0 namespaces) providing a more
consistent behaviour across processors.
====

If an EA-PDF file contains any of the following custom EA-PDF structure elements,
then the following rolemap SHALL be included.

[[table-10]]
.custom EA-PDF structure elements and their rolemapping to PDF 1.7
[cols="a,a",options="header"]
|===
| Custom EA-PDF structure element | Rolemapped PDF 1.7 tag

| `Mail_Message`      | Document
| `Mail_ContentGroup` | Part
| `Mail_ContentSet`   | Art
| Mail_Field
.3+| _The PDF Writer SHALL choose the most appropriate PDF 1.7 structure element,
such as P (paragraph), Span, list, or table tags._
| `Mail_FieldName`
| `Mail_FieldValue`

|===

NOTE: the use of Mail_ContentGroup is to semantically represent the grouping of
Content Sets. It does not directly relate to a property of an email message.

Custom EA-PDF tags SHALL only occur on marked content sequences (i.e. they SHALL
NOT occur as marked content points). The _tag_ operand of marked content sequence
operators SHALL match the corresponding custom EA-PDF structure element name.

NOTE: Reason: ISO 32000 only has a recommendation for matching operands to structure
element names.

The parent and immediate child containment rules for the custom EA-PDF tags SHALL
be as follows.

[[table-11]]
.custom EA-PDF tag parent and immediate child occurrence requirements
[cols="a,a,a",options="header"]
|===
| Parent | Occurrence | Immediate Child footnote:[Other nesting requirements are described below.]

.3+| Mail_Message | 0 .. _n_ | Mail_ContentGroup
| 0 .. _n_ | `Mail_ContentSet`
| 0 | _All other custom EA-PDF tags as defined in <<table-10>>._
.2+| Mail_ContentGroup | 1 .. _n_ | Mail_ContentSet
| 0 | _All other custom EA-PDF tags as defined in <<table-10>>._
.2+| Mail_ContentSet | 0 .. _n_ | Mail_ContentField
| 0 | _All other custom EA-PDF tags as defined in <<table-10>>._
.3+| Mail_Field | 1 .. _n_ | Mail_FieldName
| 0 .. _n_ | Mail_FieldValue

NOTE: email field values may be blank and thus not present.
| 0 | _All other custom EA-PDF tags as defined in <<table-10>>._

|===

In addition, the following requirements also apply if custom EA-PDF tags are used.

* For each Mail_Message custom EA-PDF tag, there SHALL be at least 1 Mail_ContentGroup
or Mail_ContentSet immediate child.

NOTE: this requirement ensures there are no empty email messages in the logical
structure without a related_ Content Set.

* Every _Content Set_ shall be tagged with a Mail_ContentSet custom EA-PDF tag.
* All header fields rendered into page content SHOULD be tagged with a Mail_FieldName
and Mail_FieldValue custom EA-PDF tag (if present).

NOTE: there are no explicit requirements related to email header fields and the
`Mail_FieldName` or `Mail_FieldValue` custom EA-PDF tags as validation requires
processing of the original source email assets.

* A Mail_FieldValue custom EA-PDF tag SHALL NOT occur without a corresponding a
Mail_FieldName tag inside the immediate containing parent Mail_Field tag.

NOTE: the ordering of the `Mail_FieldName` and `Mail_FieldValue` custom EA-PDF
tags is purposely not defined to support right-to-left languages and other layouts.
The requirement reflects that an email field needs to be tagged with `Mail_FieldName`
only.

Certain custom EA-PDF tags may optionally also contain specific custom user property
structure attributes when the associated attribute object dictionary has a value
of _UserProperties_ for the owner (*O*) entry. In this situation, the user property
dictionary *N* SHALL be PDF ASCII strings with *V* entries as defined in <<table-12>>
below.

[[table-12]]
.EA-PDF UserProperties custom attributes *N* and *V* entries
[cols="2a,a,3a",options="header"]
|===

| *Mail_MessageID*         | string            | `Mail_Message`
| *Mail_GUID*              | string            | `Mail_Message`
| *Mail_ContentSetType*    | string            | `Mail_ContentGroup`, `Mail_ContentSet`

| *Mail_Sent*              | PDF date (string) | `Mail_Message`, `Mail_FieldValue`
| *Mail_Raw_Sent*          | string            | `Mail_Message`, `Mail_FieldValue`
| *Mail_Subject*           | string            | `Mail_Message`, `Mail_FieldValue`
| *Mail_SizeInBytes*       | integer (â‰¥ 0)     | `Mail_Message`, `Mail_FieldValue`
| *Mail_NumberAttachments* | integer (â‰¥ 0)     | `Mail_Message`, `Mail_FieldValue`
| *Mail_Cc*                | string            | `Mail_Message`, `Mail_FieldValue`
| *Mail_Raw_Cc*            | string            | `Mail_Message`, `Mail_FieldValue`
| *Mail_Bcc*               | string            | `Mail_Message`, `Mail_FieldValue`
| *Mail_Raw_Bcc*           | string            | `Mail_Message`, `Mail_FieldValue`
| *Mail_InReplyTo*         | string            | `Mail_Message`, `Mail_FieldValue`
| *Mail_*... (_other email header fields_) | string, number or Boolean only | `Mail_Message`, `Mail_FieldName`, `Mail_FieldValue`

|===

NOTE: the UserProperties *N* entries match the DPM data (see <<table-07>> and <<table-08>>
above) and XMP metadata fields (see <<table-18>> below) when prefixed with "_Mail_"
to allow validation. <<ISO_32000_2,table=362>> recommends only to use strings,
Booleans and numbers so name values are represented as strings for UserProperties
*V* values.

When using custom user property structure attributes, the values (*V* entries)
SHOULD NOT be truncated or modified from the original source email, even if the
page rendering of the equivalent information is cropped, hidden, obscured, or truncated.

Implicit or explicit _ Art_ (article, implicit via *Mail_ContentSet*) child structure
elements SHALL only be used to represent each _Content Set_ in all `PDF/mail-1`
files.

NOTE: this can be validated for consistency using PDF outlines and the document
part metadata.

For `PDF/mail-1{m, mi}` files, each email SHALL be represented by an implicit or
explicit _Document_ structure element (implicitly via *Mail_Message*).

NOTE: this can be validated for consistency using PDF outlines and document part
metadata.

In `PDF/mail-1{c, ci}` container files the explicit top-level _Document_ structure
element represents the container PDF and its related _Content Sets_ (_not_ emails,
as these are in the embedded files in the collection).

=== XMP metadata

Like all PDF ISO subsets, EA-PDF files SHALL presumptively declare their full conformance
using the document catalog XMP *Metadata* stream. This XMP metadata stream provides
the definitive information about the email messages preserved in the EA-PDF file.

All EA-PDF files SHALL contain a Document Catalog *Metadata* XMP stream including
the following namespaces and required prefixes, in addition to those required for
their appropriate PDF/A conformance:

[[table-14]]
.Custom XMP namespaces and prefixes for EA-PDF
[cols="2a,a",options="header"]
|===
| URI | Required Prefix

| http://www.pdfa.org/eapdf/         | `pdfmail`
| http://www.pdfa.org/eapdf/ns/id/   | `pdfmailid`
| http://www.pdfa.org/eapdf/ns/meta/ | `pdfmailmeta`
|===

NOTE: namespace URIs do not need to exist as websites (i.e., clickable URLs).

NOTE: the PDF/A conformance level is determined by EA-PDF Creation Software and
can be based on features present in the email messages.

_EA-PDF Creation Software_ SHALL also record the `dc:creator[0]`, `pdf:Producer` and
the date of the EA-PDF file creation date (`xmp:CreateDate`) in the standard XMP
metadata fields as defined in <<PDF_A_3,table=7>>. The `dc:title["x-default"]` property
SHOULD also be set.

NOTE: Reason: many PDF viewers display Title information at the top of viewing
window.

==== Conformance and identification

The EA-PDF Identification schema SHALL use the namespace URI
http://www.pdfa.org/eapdf/ns/id/ and SHALL use the schema namespace prefix
`pdfmailid` as follows:

[[table-15]]
.EA-PDF identification schema properties
[cols="a,a,a",options="header"]
|===
| XMP Property | XMP Value Type | Value

| pdfmailid:version footnote:[`pdfmailid:part` is reserved for future ISO standardization.]
| Open choice of integer | 1
| pdfmailid:rev | Open choice of integer | 2024 (representing a year)
| pdfmailid:conformance | Open choice of text. Always lowercase. | 's', 'si', 'm', 'mi', 'c' or 'ci'The "i" designator SHALL always be last if present.

|===

NOTE: Reason: this is how all PDF ISO subsets declare conformance in XMP, with
similarly named properties. The use of a new namespace for EA-PDF ensures that
an EA-PDF file can also be marked as conforming with PDF/A and PDF/UA, and that
future versions or revisions of EA-PDF can also be supported. This also forces
PDF files to conform to a single conformance level for such standard, including
EA-PDF.

As a result of PDF/A-3 requirements, an XMP extension schema for EA-PDF must also
be included according to PDF/A-3, Â§6.6.2.3.2 requirements if the EA-PDF conforms
to PDF/A-3.

==== Source email assets

For non-isolated EA-PDF files that include any source email assets (whether original
raw (unmodified) source email asset(s) or modified), additional metadata about
those source email asset(s) SHALL be recorded in the document-level (Document Catalog)
XMP metadata.

The following structured metadata in the document-level XMP *Metadata* stream using
the namespace http://www.pdfa.org/eapdf/ns/meta/ SHALL be included as an unordered
set of one or more source email asset container descriptions using pdfmailmeta:assets
as follows:

.EA-PDF source email asset structured XMP metadata
[cols="a,a,a",options="header"]
|===
| Source email asset property | XMP Value Type | XMP Metadata description

| `Filename` | _Required_
| Text string of the case-sensistive filename of the original email asset.

NOTE: XMP in PDF is always UTF-8 so the filename can contain Unicode characters.
It may also include absolute or relative path components or platform-specific components
in the metadata.

| `SizeInBytes` | _Required_ | A non-negative integer that is the size (in bytes)
of this source email asset.

| `ContentType` | _Required_
| Free text string representing the IANA Media Type (including any required parameters)
of this email asset.Refer to <<table-17>> below for commonly used source email
asset Media Types. Other IANA Media Types are allowed, but non-specific generic
Media Types such as application/octet-stream , application/zip, or text/plain SHOULD
NOT be used.

| `NumberMessages` | _Optional_ | A non-negative integer representing the number
of individual email messages in this source email asset that have been successfully
rendered into this EA-PDF file.

NOTE: emails with fatal errors and that could not be converted to EA-PDF are not
included in this count.

NOTE: this value cannot be validated without re-processing the original source
email assets. However it can be checked for consistency with the Content Sets,
outlines, DPM, etc.

| `Checksum` | _Required_ | The MD5 checksum of the original email asset, stored
as a 32 character long hexadecimal ASCII string (upper and lowecase alphanumerics).

NOTE: this checksum is not used for security and is only provided to help detect
if the embedded data has been modified or corrupted.

|===

NOTE: Reason: an unordered set of source email assets supports sets of files, with
only a single asset needing to list the number of email messages.

==== Email headers

All non-empty _Core Fields_ for each email in `PDF/mail-1{s, si, m, mi}` files
SHALL be recorded as structured metadata in the document-level XMP *Metadata* stream
using the namespace "http://www.pdfa.org/eapdf/ns/meta/" with the required schema
namespace prefix pdfmailmeta as an unordered set of email containers as follows.

EA-PDF Creation Software may add additional email header fields using the case-sensitive
email header field name. EA-PDF Creation Software may also prefix header fields
with "Raw-" to indicate a raw value from the email that would otherwise be an error
when using a more rigid or structured XMP data type (e.g. an XMP dateTime).

NOTE: these properties cannot be "SHALL" requirements as they cannot be validated
without re-processing the original source email. They can however be validated
for consistency with_ Content Sets, outlines, DPM, and logical structure (if present)
in the EA-PDF file.

[[table-18]]
.EA-PDF Core Fields footnote:[Note that some Core Fields such as `Message-ID` and Subject are optional according to <<RFC_822>>. Other field values may also be empty/blank in draft emails.] as structured XMP metadata
[cols="a,a,a",options="header"]
|===
| Core Field | Requirement | XMP Metadata description

| `To` | _Optional_ | Represented as an ordered sequence of FOAF Agents containers
(`foaf:Agent` entries), each with required `foaf:mbox` email address and optional
`foaf:name` or other FOAF Agent fields.

| `Raw-To` | _Optional_ | Free text string, directly reflecting the email header
To: field value.

| `From` | _Optional_ | Represented as an ordered sequence of FOAF Agents containers
(`foaf:Agent` entries), each with required `foaf:mbox` email address and optional
`foaf:name` or other FOAF Agent fields.

| `Raw-From` | _Optional_ | Free text string, directly reflecting the email header
From: field value.
| `Sent` | _Required_ | Represented as a xsd:dateTime.

Due to potential errors in email header Sent: fields, this value may have been
normalized to a valid XMP date/time value by _EA-PDF Creation Software_.

NOTE: RFC 822 defines this field as "Date" which can be ambiguous when out of context.
EA-PDF uses the term "Sent".
| Raw-Sent | _Sometimes required_ | Required when the email header Sent: field
value has an error that would result in an invalid XMP dateTime. Otherwise SHOULD
not be present.

Represented as a free text string, directly reflecting the email header Sent field
value.

NOTE: RFC 822 defines this field as "Date" which can be ambiguous when out of context.
EA-PDF uses the term "Sent".
| `Subject` | _Optional_ | Free text string.
| `Message-ID` | _Optional_ | Free text string.

NOTE: some Message IDs may include an "@" sign and domain name and appear as an
email address, however Message-IDs are never FOAF Agents.
| `Mail_GUID` | _Required_ | An XMP GUID (see <<ISO_16684_1_2019,clause=8.2.2.3>>)
that uniquely identifies an email represented as a single free text string.

NOTE: according to RFC 822 the `Message-ID`: core field is optional, so this required
synthetic unique identifier allows a mapping between XMP metadata and PDF content.

NOTE: this property name matches the other uses in EA-PDF, including PDF second-class
keys.
| `SizeInBytes` | _Optional_ | A non-negative integer representing the size
(in bytes) of the original source of only this email message.

NOTE: this property is only meaningful for certain email formats such as EML, MSG
and MBOX.

NOTE: this property includes all headers, all email attachments that may be encoded
as Base64, etc. in the original email format.
| `NumberAttachments` | _Required if 1 or more attachments_ | A non-negative integer
representing the number of email attachments in this email message. Default value
is 0.

| `Cc` | _Optional_ | Represented as an ordered sequence of FOAF Agent containers
(`foaf:Agent` entries), each with required `foaf:mbox` email address and optional `foaf:name`
or other FOAF Agent fields.

| `Raw-Cc` | _Optional_ | Free text string, directly reflecting the email header cc: field value.

| `Bcc` | _Optional_ | Represented as an ordered sequence of FOAF Agent containers
(`foaf:Agent` entries), each with required `foaf:mbox` email address and optional
`foaf:name` or other FOAF Agent fields.

| `Raw-Bcc` | _Optional_ | Free text string, directly reflecting the email header bcc: field value.

| `In-Reply-To` | _Optional_ | Unordered sequence of free text strings, directly
reflecting the email header In-Reply-To: field value(s).

NOTE: some In-Reply-To message IDs may include an "@" sign and domain name and
appear as an email address. In-Reply-To message IDs are not represented as FOAF
Agents in XMP metadata.

NOTE: although this email field can only occur once, it may contain one or
more message IDs separated by whitespace.

[NOTE,keep-separate=true]
====
by convention with other PDF ISO subset standards such as PDF/A, new XMP fields
introduced with EA-PDF generally use "camel case", with capitalization matching
the <<RFC_822>> field names. However, to support existing third party XMP schemas
and correspondence with PDF second-class names, this is not always the case and
is not mandated.
====

==== Email attachments

For EA-PDF files that include any emails with attachments (whether preserved as
PDF file annotations or removed for policy reasons), additional metadata about
all email attachments in the original source email assets SHOULD be recorded in
the document-level (Document Catalog) XMP metadata.

NOTE: this cannot be a "SHALL" requirement as it cannot be validated without re-processing
the original source email. It can however be validated for consistency with embedded
file streams in the EA-PDF file.

The following structured metadata in the document-level XMP *Metadata* stream using
the namespace http://www.pdfa.org/eapdf/ns/meta/ SHALL be included as an unordered
set of zero or more source email attachment descriptions pdfmailmeta:attachments
as follows:

[[table-19]]
.EA-PDF email attachment structured XMP metadata
[cols="a,a,a",options="header"]
|===
| Attachment property | Requirement | XMP Metadata

| `Filename` | _Required_ | A free text string representing the case-sensistive
filename of the email attachment as stored in the original email asset.

NOTE: XMP in PDF is always UTF-8 so the filename can contain Unicode characters.

NOTE: due to limitations with PDF filenames, the corresponding PDF embedded file
stream filename may not be an exact match._

NOTE: the filename can come from either the Content-Disposition header 'filename'
parameter or the Content-Type header 'name' parameter. Both are optional, so it
is possible that an email attachment will not have a filename specified in the
email headers. In this case a suitable string will need to be generated by the
EA-PDF Creation Software.

| `SizeInBytes` | _Required_ | A non-negative integer, reflecting the size
(in bytes) of this email attachment as stored in the EA-PDF as an embedded file
stream.

NOTE: email attachments that were removed for policy or cybersecurity reasons may
have zero length.

NOTE: this property is expected to match the corresponding embedded file stream
parameter dictionary *Size* entry (if present).
| `Message-ID` | _Optional_ | Text string reflecting the `Message-ID` of the original
email containing this email attachment.

| `Mail_GUID` | _Required if `Message-ID` is not present_ | Text string reflecting
the generated GUID of the email containing this email attachment.

NOTE: this property name matches the DPM entry.
| `Content-Type` | _Required_ | A free text string, representing the IANA Media
Type (including any media type parameters) of this email attachment as specified
in the original email asset.

NOTE: because of potential errors in the headers of source emails, this string
is not defined as an IANA Media Type and must always reflect the raw field in the
original source email.

NOTE: this property is equivalent to the corresponding embedded file stream dictionary
*Subtype* and *Mail_MediaTypeParameters* entries when combined according to the
algorithm above.
| `CheckSum` | _Optional_ | A 32 character ASCII text string, representing the
MD5 checksum (as hexadecimal, upper or lower case alphanumerics) of this email
attachment when processed as its raw binary data.

NOTE: this property is equivalent to the corresponding embedded file parameter
dictionary *CheckSum* entry (subject to encoding differences, if present).

NOTE: this is not security related.
