== From an email and end-user perspective

This section provides a description of the `PDF/mail-1` file format from the perspective
of readers familiar with email such as <<RFC_822>> and related RFCs, however it needs
to be read by everyone.

This section is written and structured from an [underline]#_input_# point of view
and contains additional explanation and reasoning, including recommendations that
would normally be found in Application Notes or similar supporting publications.
In addition, testing of a selection of existing PDF applications was performed to
support LWG requests for reasonable support in existing non-EA-PDF aware legacy software.

In this section, the term "render" implies the PDF content that _EA-PDF Creation
Software_ creates as PDF content streams (operators and operands, using associated
resources and other PDF objects such as images and fonts) such that the resulting
PDF pages have the "look and feel" of email such as might be seen in an email client.

Many of the technical requirements for EA-PDF are achieved by direct reference to
PDF/A.

It is expected that extant email files will have their own errors, extensions, or
other deviations from official specifications. How this is handled by _EA-PDF Creation
Software_ is beyond the scope of this document.

NOTE: EA-PDF Writer: EA-PDF creation software may choose to log processing errors
encountered during conversion into EA-PDF files as either machine-readable metadata,
additional rendered content (i.e., as a multi-page report for humans), or both. However,
even with invalid emails, an output EA-PDF file must always be valid according to
this specification, the appropriate PDF/A conformance level, and ISO 32000.

=== Key PDF features

By way of a gentle introduction to PDF, certain PDF features are described below
at a high level so readers unfamiliar with PDF can understand their relevance in
achieving the goals of faithful and verifiable email preservation and representation
as PDF pages. This section summarizes these key features but does not state any formal
requirements (i.e., there are no technical "SHALL" or "SHOULD" statements).

==== Metadata

Metadata is critically important to email preservation and management using EA-PDF.
It both presumptively identifies EA-PDF files and declares the necessary conformance
as well as providing definitive descriptive information about the preserved emails.
Additional requirements and best practice for metadata (beyond what is required by
PDF/A and this EA-PDF specification) need to be defined by the policy and procedure
frameworks in which EA-PDF is used. EA-PDF follows the metadata conventions used
in the ISO 19005 family of PDF/A standards.

EA-PDF also additionally supports the representation of metadata or any other information
as human readable content on PDF pages to better support non-EA-PDF legacy software
that cannot access XMP metadata (generically referred to as "conversion reports"
in this document).

Metadata in PDF can be stored in two formats: XML-based XMP in *Metadata* streams,
and as PDF string objects in the traditional Document Information PDF dictionary.
PDF/A and the other modern PDF ISO subsets all use XMP Metadata to store their conformance
level [underline]#and# other information. In accordance with recommendations in the
<<XMP>> standard and to facilitate interoperability with the broadest range of software,
EA-PDF leverages existing XMP schemas such as Dublin Core, XMP Basic Schema, and
the Adobe PDF Schema for certain basic information (see <<XMPNamespaces>>). XMP supports
custom data and, where possible, EA-PDF will extend XMP by utilizing existing XMP
or RDF ontologies, such as Dublin Core, Friend Of A Friend <<FOAF>>, <<PREMIS>>,
<<EAXS>>, etc.

NOTE: leveraging existing specifications for metadata will hopefully make EA-PDF
files more compatible with existing document and archival management systems that
already support XMP across multiple file formats.

All XMP metadata stored in EA-PDF files must be encoded as UTF-8.

NOTE: ISO 19005-3 PDF/A-3 did not mandate UTF-8 based XMP whereas the latest dated
revision of PDF/A-4 adds this requirement. Testing of legacy viewers indicates problematic
support for XMP with non-UTF-8 content. EA-PDF thus mandates encoding all XMP as
UTF-8 for the widest possible support and matches with the latest dated revision
of PDF/A-4.

XMP Metadata used in EA-PDF files such as `PDF/mail-1m` and `PDF/mail-1c` may be
very large as it covers many emails, attachments, etc. and potentially XMP Extension
Schemas. For this reason, _EA-PDF Creation Software_ may wish to compress the XMP
Metadata, however this may reduce interoperability with some document and archive
management systems.

Any use of custom XMP data in `PDF/mail-1` files that conform to PDF/A-3 must also
include the related XMP extension schema according to the requirements defined in
<<PDF_A_3,clause=6.6.2.3.2>>.

NOTE: Reason: ISO 19005-3 PDF/A-3 mandates the use of XMP extension schemas either
in the same XMP metadata stream as the custom data, or in the main document catalog
*Metadata* stream. PDF/A-4 does not mandate XMP extension schemas, while also supporting
Associated Files with an *AFRelationship* value of Schema.

NOTE: EA-PDF Writer: as discussed in the LWG, PDF/A-3 XMP extension schemas can be
very complex while the use of PDF/A-4 allows alternate schema formats to be included.

An EA-PDF file will contain many logical groupings of XMP metadata as illustrated
in <<figure-06>> below

NOTE: <<figure-06>> below does not necessarily represent the physical ordering of
the document level XMP metadata. XMP Extension Schemas are only required if the EA-PDF
file conforms to PDF/A-3. PDF/A-4 files may alternatively optionally embed schemas
using Associated Files with an *AFRelationship* value of Schema.

[[figure-06]]

image::figure-06.png[]

Any PDF dictionary or stream object may also contain a *Metadata* entry referencing
an XML-based XMP metadata stream allowing metadata to be logically and semantically
associated with different objects in an EA-PDF file. Example use-cases of this are
discussed below. See <<MetadataStreams>> and <<ISO_32000_2,clause=14.3.2>>.

All EA-PDF files are required to have a Document Catalog *Metadata* stream that declares
the EA-PDF profile [underline]#and# a corresponding PDF/A conformance level [underline]#and#
a set of email-related _Core Fields_. Additional metadata in any *Metadata* stream
may also be stored, in addition to what EA-PDF and PDF/A explicitly require. EA-PDF
Creation Software must also record *dc:Creator*, *pdf:Producer* and *xmp:CreateDate*
information in the document-level XMP metadata for all EA-PDF files.

An EA-PDF file may also use <<PDF_Declarations>> in any *Metadata* XMP stream to
specify compliance with other 3^rd^ party specifications or profiles, such as the
EAXS specification <<EAXS>> or PREMIS <<PREMIS>>. It is _strongly recommended_ that
all Declarations be publicly recorded at https://pdfa.org/declarations/.

<<PDF_A_3,clause=6.1.5>> permits the use of the Document Information dictionary
(<<ISO_32000_2,clause=14.3.3>>, as referenced by the document trailer *Info* entry),
however PDF/A-4 prohibits the general use of this dictionary footnote:[<<ISO_32000_2>>
deprecated the Document Information dictionary in preference for XMP metadata streams
while PDF/A-4 only permits Document Information dictionaries with *ModDate* entries.].
To support the widest range of non-EA-PDF aware legacy software, EA-PDF files that
are not required to use any PDF 2.0 features and thus can be PDF/A-3 compatible may
wish to use PDF/A-3 in order to include a Document Information dictionary and provide
a better experience with non-EA-PDF aware legacy software.

NOTE: Reason: a lot of legacy software has no functionality to display XMP metadata
and can only report strings from the conventional PDF Document Information dictionary.
Furthermore, software that can display XMP metadata may not have appropriate user
interfaces for large XMP metadata such as required by EA-PDF.

NOTE: EA-PDF Writer: <<PDF_A_3,table=7>> defines a "crosswalk" of how the XMP and
Document Information metadata ought to be aligned.

NOTE: EA-PDF Writer: when choosing between PDF/A-3 and PDF/A-4, it is necessary to
appreciate the PDF 2.0 specific features. PDF 2.0 specific features include PDF Unicode
strings using UTF-8 (convert to UTF-16BE for compatibility with PDF 1.7). Certain
other PDF 2.0 features such as Collection *Folders*, Document Part Metadata and new
logical structure features (e.g. namespaces) can be written to PDF 1.7 but will be
ignored (treated as unknown private data) by legacy software.

_Pages and content sets_

Page content comprises the graphic operators and operands that describe the painting
operations necessary to draw a PDF page. For the purposes of EA-PDF, PDF/A defines
all necessary requirements to ensure a fully device-independent and reliable static
page appearance for the visual representation of emails. PDF/A also defines all additional
font requirements to ensure extractable and searchable Unicode text are present.

_EA-PDF Creation Software_ is responsible for ensuring that the page content and
related font information is correct according to PDF/A requirements. EA-PDF does
not otherwise prescribe how emails are to be rendered.

EA-PDF files will have multiple "sets" of pages that are related – for example, a
set of pages for a text/plain email body, a different set of pages for a text/html
body of the same email, front matter, conversion report(s), sets of pages for lists
of attachments or embedded files, etc. Although `PDF/mail-1{c, ci}` container files
do not directly contain pages from email, they may contain front matter, conversion
reports, etc. In EA-PDF each of these sets is referred to as a _Content Set_, where
each _Content Set_ is a sequential set of pages that always start on a new page.
Each _Content Set_ is always at least 1 page in length resulting in EA-PDF files
always having at least one page.

NOTE: Reason: having each _Content Set_ start on a new page makes the page extraction
of specific emails (or renderings of emails) easier, simpler and supported by more
software, as well as supporting less capable non-EA-PDF aware legacy viewers that
do not support all forms of destination and sub-page navigation.

NOTE: there are no limits to the number of pages that a PDF file may contain, however
some legacy software may have restrictions.

NOTE: `PDF/mail-1{c, ci}` files require PDF software that supports PDF Collections
(PDF 1.7), otherwise only the container PDF may be accessible and no folder hierarchical
will be visible. Not all legacy software can display an embedded files list.

There are three distinct PDF features EA-PDF leverages to support _Content Set_ understanding
and machine validation of EA-PDF:

. Outlines (also known as "bookmarks") – for user navigation;
. Logical structure and Tagged PDF footnote:[The PDF 1.7 standard structure elements
are valid in both PDF 1.7 (PDF/A-3) and PDF 2.0 (PDF/A-4) files.] – content semantics
with limited validation when present;
. Document Part Metadata (also known as DPart/DPM) – for richer capabilities and
stronger validation.

The PDF outline feature (commonly known as "bookmarks") must mirror the
_Content Set_ hierarchy for easy navigation in most interactive PDF viewers.
_EA-PDF Creation Software_ may also decide to add additional outline entries for
longer emails, semantically rich emails (e.g., those with headings), or other use
cases that support users navigating an EA-PDF file in more detail in interactive
viewers. However, this is insufficiently deterministic for software, not the least
because the text of each bookmark is flexible and might be localized.

NOTE: EA-PDF Writer: this specification does not prescribe the *Title* text to use
in outline nodes, not the least because of localization and the variety of emails.
To support the widest range of non-EA-PDF aware legacy interactive viewers, it is
recommended to use either_ PDFDocEncoding _(effectively US ASCII) or UTF-16BE encoding
and to keep text relatively short (as some viewers do not support resizing or wrapping
of bookmark text). Color (*C*) and styling (*F*) can also be used, but support in
legacy software varies.

To support a sematic understanding of _Content Sets_ by EA-PDF aware software, logical
structure and Tagged PDF can also be used. These PDF features are not direct user
navigational features and are not widely supported in legacy software. The logical
structure requirements specified in this document are optional and limited to email
header representation, and only reference the PDF 1.7 standard structure elements
(which is also the default standard structure set in PDF 2.0). More detailed additional
logical structure and semantic tagging may be added by EA-PDF Writers, including
the use of a custom tag set defined by this specification.

The addition of standard tagged PDF and logical structure semantics is
_strongly recommended_ for richly formatted emails, such as HTML bodies. For PDF/A-4
files, EA-PDF also defines a custom namespace.

When present, EA-PDF (like PDF) requires that the logical structure tree root structure
element is always a [underline]#_single_# _Document_ structure element, representing
the entire EA-PDF file:

* For `PDF/mail-1{s, si, m, mi}` files, every email is represented by a nested _Document_
structure element, directly nested below the top-level _Document_ structure element
that represents the `PDF/mail-1` file itself. Again, each email may use the Mail_Message
custom EA-PDF tag which is always rolemapped to _Document_.

* In `PDF/mail-1{c, ci}` container files this top-level _Document_ structure element
represents the container PDF and its related _Content Sets_(_not_ emails, as these
are in the embedded files in the collection). Thus the Mail_Message custom EA-PDF
tag will never occur in `PDF/mail-1{c, ci}` container files.

Optional _Part_ structure elements or Mail_ContentGroup custom EA-PDF tags
(which is always rolemapped to _Part_) may also be used to represent additional hierarchical
structure, but there will always be _Art_ (article) child structure elements or Mail_ContentSet
custom EA-PDF tags (which are always rolemapped to _Art_) of the implicit or explicit
_Document_ or _Part_ structure elements that can be used to semantically encapsulate
each _Content Set_ in all EA-PDF profiles.

NOTE: the structure element sets formally defined in <<ISO_32000_1_2008>> (PDF 1.7)
and <<ISO_32000_2>> (PDF 2.0) are different, however for the purpose of EA-PDF Content
Sets only nested implicit or explicit_ Document, Part and Art _structure elements
from the PDF 1.7 standard structure element set are utilized. To enable the broadest
range of non-EA-PDF aware legacy software, PDF 2.0-only standard structure elements
(e.g.,_ DocumentPart) _are not mandated_.

[[figure-07]]
.Conceptual illustration of logical structure using the custom EA-PDF tag set
image::figure-07.png[]

To enable improved reuse and accessibility, EA-PDF additionally defines a set of
custom tags (structure element types) for optionally semantically marking up PDF
page content streams to identify _Core Field_ information using a custom PDF 2.0
namespace. All keys are purposely prefixed with the registered second-class PDF name
"Mail" followed by an underscore (i.e. /Mail_… ) so that identifiable semantics remain
after content or page extraction or processing by legacy software which may not support
or maintain custom logical structure. The role-mapping of some custom EA-PDF structure
elements back to approximate standard structure types is [underline]#_not_# defined,
allowing flexibility in the way that _Core Field_ information is presented.

NOTE: EA-PDF Writer: different writers may choose to present the Core Field information
as spans, paragraphs, lists, or in a tabular format. Having flexibility in the role-map
allows EA-PDF writers to most appropriately provide the "approximate equivalents"
in the PDF 1.7 standard structure elements for their presentation choice.

The PDF 2.0 feature called Document Part Metadata (<<ISO_32000_2,clause=14.12>> –
also referred to as *DPart*/*DPM*) is also used by EA-PDF footnote:[Although Document
Part Metadata was formally documented as a part of core PDF 2.0 in ISO 32000-2, its
initial use was defined in PDF 1.6 with PDF/VT-2 files (ISO 16612-2:2010). PDF/A
does not prohibit the inclusion of private data so long as that private data does
not impact rendering – and Document Part Metadata has no influence on rendering and
is thus acceptable in all PDF/A files utilized by EA-PDF.]. This is a tree-like data
structure using PDF object syntax, like the logical structure tree (but smaller),
that can additionally express high-level semantics or associate data about page ranges.
For EA-PDF aware software, the Document Part Metadata feature provides an additional
rich programmatic (deterministic) understanding of _Content Sets_ and can be used
for improved validation capabilities. Only the unique email identifiers (such as
`Message-ID/Mail_GUID`) are stored in the Document Part Metadata allowing EA-PDF
aware software to deterministically and reliably map _Content Sets_ back to the definitive
XMP metadata.

NOTE: Reason: duplicating email metadata in the DPart tree is unnecessary and makes
files larger.

[[figure-08]]
.Conceptual illustration of a simplified Document Part Metadata tree
image::figure-08.png[]

The use of Document Part Metadata allows EA-PDF aware software to easily identify
or logically group pages into like sets, since EA-PDF does not (and cannot) prescribe
page counts for every possible _Content Set_. The *DPM* dictionaries in Document
Part Metadata can also have Associated Files and *Metadata* streams to provide additional
data. This is achievable [underline]#_without_# needing to parse page content streams
and might be used to improve email-centric navigation in interactive EA-PDF aware
software or to batch-process multiple EA-PDF files (e.g., extract all pages that
represent a specific kind of _Content Set_, identify EA-PDF files with text/html
page renderings, find XMP metadata streams or associated files linked to specific
kinds of _Content Sets_, etc.).

==== Embedded files

PDF files can contain multiple embedded files which are often presented in a dedicated
pane in the user interface of interactive PDF viewers or reported by console or server
applications. The PDF file format supports various methods (data structures) for
referencing embedded files in PDF including file attachment annotations, files in
PDF collections, associated files, and assets associated with multimedia.

PDF does not internally contain a file system and simulates embedded files with PDF
objects (specifically a file specification dictionary and associated embedded file
stream). As a result, PDF supports [underline]#_different_# embedded files having
the [underline]#_same filename_# and multiple references with different filenames
to the same embedded data. No PDF specification or standard specifies how applications
should curate the list of embedded files in PDFs nor how the list is to be presented
(for example indicating different filenames for the same embedded data or contextualizing
duplicate filenames). As a result, legacy PDF applications vary greatly in which
files are displayed and the context of the files listed.

NOTE: some legacy applications only display embedded files associated with File Attachment
annotations, other legacy applications list only those in the *EmbeddedFiles* name
tree, while some list files from both sources (sometimes resulting in duplicate entries).
Other viewers may require a PDF page to be viewed before embedded files associated
with file attachment annotations are listed.

Embedded files in a PDF can be utilized by several distinct PDF features relevant
to email:

* File attachment annotations (<<ISO_32000_2,clause=12.5.6.15>>), typically represented
as paperclip icons on pages that when clicked open the file. In an email context,
these are contextually like email attachments. File attachment annotations are always
associated with PDF pages and have a visual on-page representation via the annotation
appearance stream;

NOTE: embedded files associated with PDF File attachment annotations do not have
to be listed in the *EmbeddedFiles* name tree, however this can mean that some legacy
software applications no not detect their presence until the page is viewed.

* Rich media assets, like 3D, movies, animations, or audio files. In an email context,
these may originate as an embedded asset in the source email, or are external assets
referenced by the body of a source email, and thus are needed by EA-PDF to render
and accurately preserve the appearance of an email as PDF page content. As a result,
they will need to be preserved as embedded file streams in EA-PDF files (note that
this is a rare but distinct use-case from email attachments above);

NOTE: both PDF/A-3 and PDF/A-4 prohibit Sound, Screen, and Movie annotations, while
PDF/A-4e limits support to 3D and RichMedia annotation subtypes and the capabilities
of PDF/A-4f. PDF 2.0 RichMedia annotations list their assets in a separate asset
name tree in the RichMedia Content Dictionary (*Assets* entry), however most legacy
software applications do not make visible this list of files.

NOTE: EA-PDF Writer: if 3D or RichMedia content is required to represent email, then
the EA-PDF file will need to conform to PDF/A-4e, which is a superset of PDF/A-4f
(and thus allows other embedded files).

* PDF Collections (<<ISO_32000_2,clause=12.3.5>>), also known as "Portable Collections",
"Portfolios", "Packages", or "Binders" presents hierarchical folder-like views of
sets (collections) of embedded files. In an email context, this is contextually like
how typical email client software presents folders and sub-folders of emails for
organizing email.

NOTE: ISO 32000 PDF Collections require that all files comprising the collection
are listed in the *EmbeddedFiles* name tree.

* The PDF feature known as Associated Files allows specific embedded files to have
a defined simple semantic relationship with a specific PDF object via the *AFRelationship*
entry. For example, a GIF or PNG image used in an email cannot be directly used by
PDF and must first be converted to an alternate format such as an Image XObject.
The raw GIF/PNG however can still be faithfully preserved by embedding it directly
into the PDF as an associated file of the Image XObject with a _Source_ relationship.
Associated Files were first added to PDF 1.7 by PDF/A-3 and later adopted into
ISO 32000-2 with PDF 2.0 with an increased set of *AFRelationship* key values
footnote:[C2PA further extends the set of *AFRelationship* values in ISO 32000-2
with a value of _C2PA_Manifest._ C2PA is not precluded from use in EA-PDF.]. See
<<AssociatedFiles>> and <<ISO_32000_2,clause=14.13>>.

NOTE: Associated Files are not technically required to be listed in the *EmbeddedFiles*
name tree, however for interoperability this is strongly recommended as all PDF/A
conforming interactive processors must be capable of displaying information from
the *EmbeddedFiles* name tree. For PDF/A-4f there must also be an *EmbeddedFiles*
name tree present.

PDF/A only permits embedded files in formats other than PDF/A in PDF/A-3 and the
PDF/A-4f and PDF/A-4e conformance levels. Thus, specific EA-PDF profiles have limitations
on which PDF/A version and conformance levels may be used – see <<table-02>> above.

Note that PDF embedded files in the *EmbeddedFiles* name tree, Associated Files,
or via file attachment annotations form a flat list (i.e., there is no folder or
inherent hierarchy), and there is no requirement to have unique filenames, so navigation
with legacy software of large `PDF/mail-1{m, mi, c, ci}` files may be less than ideal.
EA-PDF aware software can additionally utilize other EA-PDF data to provide a far
better navigation experience relevant to archival management of email.

NOTE: some non-EA-PDF aware legacy software displays additional information such
as the page or the value of the *AFRelationship* key. Based on experimentation with
current interactive software, embedded files that have a page number will generally
relate to file attachment annotations, whereas those without are likely related to
the entire document – but this is not mandated.

PDF file specification strings with absolute or relative paths
(see <<ISO_32000_2,clause=7.11.2>>) must not be used.

NOTE: although PDF file specification strings can specify both absolute and relative
paths with filenames, most existing legacy PDF viewers do not support this feature
and thus these features are prohibited in EA-PDF. The PDF Portable Collections *Folders*
feature is used to preserve folder hierarchies in_ `PDF/mail-1{ci,ci}` files.

The PDF embedded file stream dictionary (<<ISO_32000_2,table=44>>) only records the
IANA media type as the top-level media type and its description as the *Subtype*
value, with IANA media type parameters not permitted. Thus EA-PDF adds an optional
custom entry *Mail_MediaTypeParameters* to record any media type parameters in the
embedded file stream dictionary.

NOTE: see https://github.com/pdf-association/pdf-issues/issues/155[PDF Errata #155].

EA-PDF Creation Software may also wish to identify duplicated attachments and store
the embedded file data just once in the EA-PDF file to optimize file size. Common
scenarios include winmail.dat files and email threads where the same attachment may
be included multiple times. This document does not specify any specific algorithm,
but any such optimization must be based on the binary content of the embedded files
and not just the filename. Since PDF also allows referencing the same embedded file
data stream from multiple file specification dictionaries, even if the same file
is differently named across one or more emails, EA-PDF can embed it only once and
efficiently reference via different filenames.

==== URLs and hyperlinks

URLs or hyperlinks in PDF content that are intended to be actionable by end users
need to created using PDF Link annotations (<<ISO_32000_2,clause=12.5.6.5>>).

NOTE: EA-PDF Reader: although a good security practice, not all PDF viewing software
explicitly confirms URL links with the user before activation.

Note that some software may also automatically detect other links in content and
make them actionable, even though no PDF Link annotation is explicitly present for
that content.

NOTE: EA-PDF Writer: if this automatic behavior is undesirable and the choice of
viewing software cannot be controlled, then possible options available to EA-PDF
Creation Software include altering the PDF page content so that standard URL link
detection fails (e.g., replace "https:" with "hxxps:") or to add dummy Link annotations
(e.g., using a *Dest* rather than URI action via the *A* entry). Such methods are
not guaranteed.

=== Preserving source email assets

A critical aspect of establishing EA-PDF as a suitable preservation format is the
mandated preservation and embedding of the original raw source email asset(s) in
the EA-PDF file.

When `PDF/mail-1{s, m, c}` files are directly created from an email source asset
(e.g., EML, MSG, MBOX, NSF, OST/PST, etc.), that [underline]#_exact unmodified# asset_
must also be embedded via the Document Catalog *AF* (Associated Files) array entry
in order to create a verifiable preservation asset. This results in an Associated
Files array element referring to a file specification dictionary with an *AFRelationship*
entry of _Source_ (see <<ISO_32000_2,table=43>>) and with a *Subtype* value appropriate
for Media Type of the original email file format. In non-isolated profiles, there
must be at least one array element in the Document Catalog where *AFRelationship*
is _Source_.

NOTE: Reason: This ensures that the original email file used at EA-PDF creation is
always faithfully preserved and clearly identifiable. Note that *AF* is always an
array (even if there is only a single associated file), even though several PDF producers
currently generate malformed PDFs using a dictionary!

NOTE: EA-PDF does not require that only the rendered emails are present in the source
email assets. Thus, preserving an MBOX or PST file with multiple emails in `PDF/mail-1s`
where only a single email is rendered is valid although potentially inefficient.

If multiple emails from different original email assets need to be preserved as a
single EA-PDF file (e.g. a folder with multiple EML or MBOX files), then
_EA-PDF Creation Software_ has different options:

* create a `PDF/mail-1c` collection with individual EA-PDF files (`PDF/mail-1{s,m}`),
each with its own independent trusted original source email asset. This is the preferred
approach with the best support across legacy software and ensures the extracted EA-PDF
files also retain preservation qualities;
* combine the email assets into a single new email asset (e.g., concatenating EML
or MBOX files or merge all OST/PST files) prior to creating an EA-PDF file
(such as a `PDF/mail-1m`);
* embed all original source email assets, each with an *AFRelationship* value of
_Source_, and rely on EA-PDF aware software to use `Message-ID/Mail_GUID` metadata
to map each email to the correct original email source asset; or
* use an EA-PDF isolated (i) profile.

In all cases, all pre-processing steps ought to be recorded in the provenance metadata.

There is no requirement that [underline]#_only_# the email that is being preserved
must be in the original raw email asset - additional data may also be present that
is not represented by any pages in the EA-PDF file (e.g. calendar or contact entries
in OST/PST, additional emails in MBOX).

NOTE: EA-PDF Writer: if the source email data format is a multiple-email format
(such as MBOX, OST/PST or NSF) and `PDF/mail-1s` files are being created with single
email messages, then the EA-PDF Writer may elect to either export each email to a
singular format (e.g. EML) and then convert that export to `PDF/mail-1s`, or to embed
the full multi-email file as-is (however this may be large). This is a policy decision
outside of the EA-PDF file format.

If a source email format requires multiple files to be preserved as a set, then a
Related Files array might be used (see <<ISO_32000_2,clause=7.11.4.2>>) or the additional
related files can be stored as separate embedded files in the Document Catalog *AF*
array with an *AFRelationship* of _Supplement_.

NOTE: EA-PDF Writer: it is not desirable to use a format such as ZIP to store a set
of source email asset(s), as the *Subtype* of the embedded file stream would then
be application/zip, and the actual data formats of the original source email assets
inside the ZIP is hidden. Instead, use the standard PDF FLATE and LZW compression
filters that can losslessly compress the raw original email source data.

The preserved source email asset(s) in `PDF/mail-1{s, m, c}` files must reflect [underline]#at
least all# emails that are represented in that EA-PDF file. If only a subset of emails
in an MBOX, PST/OST, NSF, etc. are converted to EA-PDF, then the full original raw
source email asset (with the additional information) can be embedded. However, it
is [underline]#not# valid to store a source email assets with an *AFRelationship*
of _Source_ that do not contain [underline]#_all_# the source email content in a
`PDF/mail-1{s, m, c}` file (i.e., every email represented in `PDF/mail-1{s, m}` files
must be associated with data in the embedded source original email asset(s)) – otherwise
the "isolated" profiles must be used (`PDF/mail-1{si, mi}`) to indicate that not
all original source email assets are faithfully preserved.

All embedded source email assets need to be listed in the Document Catalog *Names*
name-tree *EmbeddedFiles* entry (<<ISO_32000_2,clause=7.7.4>>). All PDF file specification
dictionaries in EA-PDF files ought to include meaningful descriptive text.

NOTE: Reason: Many legacy software viewers use the Document Catalog Names name-tree
*EmbeddedFiles* entry to display and access embedded files. Embedded files not listed
in the *EmbeddedFiles* entry may or may not get displayed in some legacy viewers.
In some cases, embedded files associated with file attachment annotations may not
show at all or may not appear until the associated page is scrolled into view.

=== Email headers

==== Core fields

EA-PDF defines a set of common email header fields and related attributes of each
email as _Core Fields_. Each email will have its _Core Fields_ reflected in the document-level
XMP of the `PDF/mail` file that contains the email. The values used in the XMP must
be as equivalent as possible to the full value in the source email assets, subject
to representation/encoding differences between the source email and UTF-8 based XMP.

NOTE: Reason: as discussed in the LWG, the document level XMP metadata is the primary
and definitive source of email metadata used by document and archival management
systems to manage email archives. Core Field names must be consistent to enable the
most reliable searching across a diverse corpus of EA-PDF files and hence must not
be localized or vary between EA-PDF Writers. EA-PDF Writers may however localize
core fields when it renders this same information to PDF page content (e.g., "Subject:"
might be rendered as "Objet:" for French emails, but in XMP it will always be
"Subject" – the value of the field in both cases needs to be the same and not localized).

NOTE: because the rendering of Core Fields in page content may be truncated, cropped,
wrapped, localized, etc., the XMP Core Fields are to be considered the definitive
"source of truth" for all EA-PDF aware software.

The set of _Core Fields_ defined for each email stored in EA-PDF are listed in <<table-04>>
below. _Core Fields_ names usually correspond to the matching email header field
name, however EA-PDF Creation Software may add additional email header fields prefixed
with "Raw-" to indicate a raw value from the email that would otherwise be an error
when using a more rigid or structured XMP data type (see Sent vs. Raw-Sent below).
To help minimize XMP Metadata size, most blank fields do not have to be stored:

[[table-04]]
.EA-PDF Core Fields footnote:[Note that some _Core Fields_ in email, such as `Message-ID` and Subject, are optional according to <<RFC_822>>.]
[cols="a,a,2a",options="header"]
|===
| Core Field Property | Source | Condition

| `To` | Email header | If present and not blank/empty.

| `From` | Email header | If present and not blank/empty.
| `Sent` | Conversion from email header | *Required* (even if blank/empty)

NOTE: <<RFC_822>> defines this field as "Date" which can be ambiguous when out of context.
EA-PDF uses the term "Sent".
| `Raw-Sent` | Email header | *Conditionally Required* if the email header Sent field
date value contains an error that cannot be identically represented as a valid XMP
date/time. Optional otherwise.

NOTE: <<RFC_822>> defines this field as "Date" which can be ambiguous when out of
context. EA-PDF uses the term "Sent".
| `Subject` | Email header | If present and not blank/empty.
| `Message-ID` | Email header | If present and not blank/empty.
| `Cc` | Email header | If present and not blank/empty.
| `Bcc` | Email header | If present and not blank/empty.
| `In-Reply-To` | Email header | If present and not blank/empty.
| `Content-Type` | Email header | *Required* (even if blank/empty)
| `Mail_GUID` footnote:[GUID = Global Unique Identifier. EA-PDF does not prescribe
how GUIDs are generated and does not distinguish between the terms GUID and UUID
(Universally Unique Identifier, see also <<RFC_4122>>).]

| Created by EA-PDF software
| *Required*. Unique for the email and that is generated by the _EA-PDF Creation Software_.
| Original email message size (_in bytes_) | Directly from email asset | *Required.*
| Number of email attachments | Calculated from email | *Required.*

|===

All non-blank _Core Fields_ are _strongly recommended_ to also be rendered into page
content using PDF text objects.

NOTE: Reason: using PDF text objects in PDF/A compliant files such as EA-PDF ensures
that non-EA-PDF aware legacy software with text searching or extraction capabilities
ought to be able to find Core Fields in page content, even if they do not support
XMP.

NOTE: Reason: if rendering of Core Fields into visible page content was mandated
by a "SHALL" requirement then to make this validatable by software without human
checks requires additional complexity including reading the original source email
asset. Otherwise, machine validation would be unreliable as emails containing replies,
forwarded emails, or other content with similar text may ambiguously look like certain
Core Fields. PDF/A files currently do not contain any content requirements and can
be fully machine validated by software _without_ human checks and _without_ reference
to any original document - EA-PDF aims for this same level of efficiency.

Emails are generally considered identifiable by the standard email header `Message-ID`
field, however not all emails in EA-PDF files may have a `Message-ID` (e.g. draft
or unsent emails). When present, the `Message-ID` will always be present in the definitive
XMP metadata to allow easy discovery (even by non-EA-PDF aware software), but for
the purposes of defining links or relationships between PDF data in or between EA-PDF
files, the _Core Field_ `Mail_GUID` must always be used.

NOTE: EA-PDF Writer: XMP is very flexible in its definition of GUID (see <<XMP,clause=8.2.2.3>>
– it is just a string) so the email `Message-ID` field can simply be used when it
is present. When not present however, EA-PDF Writer must generate something that
is globally/universally unique and this is why `Mail_GUID` is mandated.

_EA-PDF Creation Software_ is otherwise free to choose how to layout and render the
appearance of the _Core Fields_ into page content, including using advanced renderings
or layouts that might simulate rich email client user interfaces with additional
graphics or images.

NOTE: Reason: the rendering of Core Fields can mimic the appearance of rich desktop
email clients, but importantly must be text content for non-EA-PDF aware legacy software
to find using their text search functionality (this also occurs because of the requirements
of the PDF/A conformance levels used with EA-PDF). The choice of where and how the
Core Fields are rendered, and their appearance is not further prescribed by EA-PDF.

NOTE: EA-PDF Writer: as discussed in the LWG, EA-PDF Creation Software may also decide
to repeat some or all Core Fields in the header or footers of PDF pages so that extracted
pages may retain some form of human identifiable context information. This is not
mandated but recommended.

NOTE: For some emails (e.g., unsent drafts), the value of Core Fields may not be
present. Requirements are worded such that the name of each Core Field is rendered
thus giving a visual indication to users that the corresponding Field Value is blank.
This recommendation and PDF/A both require the use of PDF text objects, ensuring
that text search in non-EA-PDF aware legacy software will work (as required by the
specified PDF/A conformance levels). However, this requirement does not mean that
the English field names defined in the email must be used, thus allowing EA-PDF to
mimic support of non-English email clients in non-English environments on the rendered
pages, but with the XMP metadata being technically equivalent to the original source
email asset.

NOTE: EA-PDF Writer: text rendering mode 3 (*Tr* operator) supports invisible text
that can still be searched and extracted by most PDF software, even if external libraries
render email appearances to bitmaps.

The positioning and layout of any additional rendered _Core Fields_ ought to be clearly
distinguishable from the rendering of email Message Bodies.

NOTE: this is a recommendation only, as it would otherwise require a human to validate.
EA-PDF files need to be fully machine validatable like PDF/A. Note that the document
XMP metadata for all email header fields (including Core Fields) can be machine validated.

==== Other header fields

_EA-PDF Creation Software_ may choose to render other email _Header Fields_ to PDF
pages or add other email _Header Fields_ to the document-level XMP metadata referenced
from the document catalog *Metadata* entry (<<ISO_32000_2,table=29>>).

NOTE: EA-PDF Writer: Since each EA-PDF Creation Software is free to choose how to
render Header Fields, the appearance of an EA-PDF email may vary between implementations.

EA-PDF also defines a custom PDF 2.0 namespace with structure elements to additionally
support richer tagging and association of email header fields and their values within
content. EA-PDF does not mandate the precise role mapping back to the PDF 1.7 standard
structure elements.

=== Message body(s)

==== Common requirements

EA-PDF does not prescribe page sizes, page layout, content reflow, wrapping, page
breaks, appearance, etc. within _Content Sets_. All textual content in the email
must be represented using PDF text objects and, because EA-PDF files also conform
to specific PDF/A conformance levels, all such text will have identifiable Unicode
codepoints.

NOTE: EA-PDF Writer: EA-PDF Creation Software is free to choose page size (media
size), margins, scaling factors, headers, footers, wrapping, etc. However, all textual
content in the email body must be represented in EA-PDF files as text objects so
that text search is possible across all software, which is also enforced by requiring
PDF/A conformance. This does not preclude the rendering of email to images so long
as the textual content is also added (like is often done with scan-to-PDF and OCR
solutions that then use text rendering mode *Tr* 3 <<ISO_32000_2,clause=9.3.6>>).
This rendering of email to images is undesirable and inefficient but is not technically
prohibited by EA-PDF or PDF/A conformance.

All pages in `PDF/mail-1` files ought to have a visible page number with equivalent
page label (see <<ISO_32000_2,clause=12.4.2>>). If Tagged PDF is also used, then
these page labels can be tagged as artifacts.

NOTE: Reason: As desired by the LWG, this allows individually extracted pages from
an EA-PDF file to remain visibly identifiable even when extracted with non-EA-PDF
aware software. Equivalent page labels also assist with logical navigation in legacy
viewers. This specification does not specify the style, where, or how page numbering
or identification labelling is placed on a page (such as the use of some email header
fields), but typically headers or footers are used.

==== Richly formatted email body formats

Richly formatted email body formats such as HTML and RTF define formatting and semantics
that can be re-applied in PDF using known techniques. _EA-PDF Creation Software_
will need to make its own reflow, wrapping, pagination and layout decisions as well
as mapping email semantics to Tagged PDF and Logical Structure if so desired.

NOTE: semantics here refer to the type of content, such as a heading, paragraph,
table, ordered or unordered list, etc. Semantics are represented with tags and attributes
in HTML, whereas PDF uses Logical Structure and Tagged PDF.

Where the color space of email message body content is not explicitly defined in
the source email format, sRGB is to be assumed and appropriate device-independent
PDF color space objects defined (as required by PDF/A).

NOTE: Reason: PDF/A requires the use of device independent color spaces to ensure
a consistent and reliable appearance across devices.

NOTE: EA-PDF Writer: sRGB support in PDF/A is best done via an *ICCBased* color space
object, which only ever needs to be embedded once in a PDF file and can be reused
as necessary. See also §8.6.5.6 Default colour spaces in <<ISO_32000_2,ISO 32000-2>>.

For `PDF/mail-1{s, si}` and `PDF/mail-1{m, mi}` files that contain pages representing
richly formatted email bodies with existing semantic information, PDF logical structure
and Tagged PDF is _strongly recommended_.

NOTE: Reason: Richly formatted emails such as HTML and RTF contain their own semantics,
so creation of equivalent PDF data is possible by EA-PDF Creation Software, but this
is not mandated since it cannot be meaningfully validated without reference to the
original source email data.

NOTE: it is not mandated that EA-PDF files are also PDF/UA compliant (in addition
to the requirement to be PDF/A compliant) as this imposes additional requirements.
However, EA-PDF Creation Software ought to retain an equivalent level of semantics
of the source email content (e.g., any semantics represented by the HTML tags of
HTML email bodies ought to be retained when converted to PDF), however determining
appropriate semantics from plain text emails is implementation dependent.

===== Referenced assets

Subject to the policy environment, _EA-PDF Creation Software_ may additionally decide
to preserve assets referenced by the original raw source email (e.g., images, SVG,
rich media, etc.), including fetching and preserving external assets from the internet.
When such assets are not natively compatible with PDF, the raw asset may also be
saved (preserved) in the EA-PDF file as an Associated File (in an *AF* array) to
the most relevant PDF object (e.g., Image XObject, Form XObject, font, etc., but
[underline]#not# the Document Catalog footnote:[Associated Files with *AFRelationship*
_Source_ in the Document Catalog *AF* array refer to the original raw source email
assets for non-isolated `PDF/mail-1{s, m, c}` files.]) with an *AFRelationship* of
_Source_. See <<AssociatedFiles>>.

Missing or corrupted assets may be visually indicated in EA-PDF output, but this
is not mandated.

NOTE: EA-PDF Writer: for example, if an image is not to be included in the PDF page
rendering, then a bounding box rectangle might be shown along with other information
as to the reason. It is not mandated because it cannot be validated without reference
to the original source email asset and policy environment.

Additionally, conversion information or other provenance information about referenced
assets (such as set by an archival policy) may also be included in the EA-PDF file
ideally as an XMP *Metadata* stream associated to the most relevant PDF object (e.g.,
Image XObject, Form XObject). See <<MetadataStreams>> and <<ISO_32000_2,clause=14.3.2>>.

NOTE: EA-PDF Writer: as illustrated below, an animated GIF image in an email might
be converted to a static JPEG (*DCTDecode*) image for inclusion in the rendered representation
in PDF. SVG might be converted to a Form XObject or rendered to a canvas and embedded
into the EA-PDF as a bitmap (Image XObject). The source asset and XMP metadata would
then be associated with those PDF objects.

NOTE: Reason: Fetching and/or storing of external assets referenced from email bodies
into EA-PDF is an archival policy matter (and not a file format requirement) due
to overhead and potential tracking and privacy issues. Storing of all assets is not
mandated because of the impact to file size – embedded assets in the source email
will already be preserved in the source email assets and thus do not have to be embedded
again. Externally referenced assets might also be fetched to assist with page layout
algorithms, but not saved into the EA-PDF. In such cases, a proxy graphic or image
of similar dimensions might be added by the EA-PDF Creation software. Machine validation
is also not possible.

Referenced assets that need conversion and result in an image ought to use Image
XObjects and not inline images.

NOTE: avoiding inline images in PDF content streams for converted assets means that
Image XObjects must be used (inline images can still be used for other purposes however).
This is because a lot of legacy software only supports Image XObjects when looking
for metadata, performing image extraction, etc. As per <<ISO_32000_2,clause=8.9.7>>
inline images are also only appropriate for very small images (4096 bytes or less).

[[figure-09]]
.Example of multiple Associated Files and Metadata streams associated with a converted asset (e.g. animated GIF converted to Image XObject)
image::figure-09.png[]

==== Plain text emails

Email bodies which are plain text (e.g., "Content-type: text/plain; charset=…" or
equivalent) lack the native formatting and semantics present in rich email body formats
such as HTML or RTF. When creating `PDF/mail-1{s, si, m, mi}` files, _EA-PDF Creation
Software_ must make additional formatting decisions such as typeface selection, font
size, text color, as well as other layout and pagination decisions to convert the
plain text email to typeset and formatted PDF page content that is PDF/A compliant.
These decisions are not mandated by this specification.

NOTE: by convention plain text emails are often displayed in email clients using
monospaced fonts, such as Courier. This document does not mandate this convention
and thus users and EA-PDF aware software are advised not to assume that a monospace
appearance implies a plain text email – but other data structures used by EA-PDF
can ensure that users know if an email rendering is of a text-based email body. PDF/A
compliance does however require that all referenced fonts are always embedded.

NOTE: although many email clients allow users to select text foreground and background
colors, font size, and possibly other font properties when displaying plain text
emails, the use of black text on the default white page background that PDF defines
is preferable for EA-PDF use-cases but is also not mandated. PDF/A compliance however
does require that device independent color is always used to ensure a reliable device-independent appearance.

For `PDF/mail-1{m, mi}` files with multiple emails, _EA-PDF Creation Software_ ought
to optimize font usage and other resources across multiple emails to reduce the overhead
of embedded fonts in the resultant EA-PDF file.

_EA-PDF Creation Software_ may add semantic markup (via Logical Structure and Tagged
PDF) for plain text emails through various additional means that are beyond the scope
of this document.

NOTE: some email clients have their own algorithms for special processing of additional
end-of-line characters in text emails which can result in different displays across
email clients.

==== URL hyperlinks

Although richly formatted email bodies may contain explicitly marked-up URLs
(such as using HTML `<a href="…">…</a>` tags), many modern email clients also detect
and make active (clickable) other URLs found in emails, including plain text email
bodies which do not contain any markup. Active URLs in email clients are commonly
shown as underlined colored text. This difference in behavior is oftentimes not obvious
to users and can mean that the presentation and functionality of email can look different
across different email clients (i.e., which URLs are active and which are not).

In PDF, active (clickable) URLs are enabled via the use of PDF Link annotations
footnote:[PDF page content that [underline]#_looks like_# URL text is not active
(clickable) unless a PDF Link annotation is also created. The appearance of the URL
text in the PDF page content has no influence on whether a URL is active (e.g. blue
underlined text is not active unless a PDF Link annotation is also created).].
_EA-PDF Creation Software_ is free to decide not to create any PDF Link annotations
(so URLs only appear as text), only create PDF Link annotations for those explicitly
marked-up URLs in richly formatted email bodies, detect URLs in the content of email
bodies (including plain text emails that contain no explicit markup) and make some
or all those links active via PDF Link annotations, or some other strategy.

NOTE: Reason: The archival policy settings ought to define such behavior, since following
links may invoke side effects, privacy/PII, tracking, or other undesirable issues.

NOTE: many legacy PDF viewers will automatically detect and make actionable text
that appears to be a URL even if it does not have an associated PDF Link annotation.
Such behavior may be controlled by a viewer option, but this is vendor specific and
beyond the scope of the ISO 32000 or this specification.

NOTE: EA-PDF Writer: one approach to try and protect against this behavior is for
EA-PDF Creation Software to explicitly add dummy Link annotations where the link
action is harmless (e.g. goes to a local destination in the same EA-PDF file, rather
than a URL on the internet).

=== Email attachments

All email attachments are faithfully preserved in EA-PDF files as file specification
dictionaries with an embedded file stream (see <<ISO_32000_2,clause=7.11.4>>) linked
to one or more File Attachment annotations (<<ISO_32000_2,clause=12.5.6.15>>).
Each file attachment annotation is associated with a page.

NOTE: Reason: almost all legacy software viewers provide basic support for PDF file
attachment annotations. File attachment annotations are typically visually represented
by paperclips on pages which is a similar metaphor used by many email clients. Technically,
the embedded file stream associated with file attachment annotations are not required
to be listed in the Document Catalog Names name-tree *EmbeddedFiles* entry.

NOTE: the file specification string associated with the embedded file stream that
represents an email attachment is expected not to contain folder names, "..", or
other path or platform components. PDF file specification strings with absolute or
relative paths (<<ISO_32000_2,clause=7.11.2>>) must not be used with EA-PDF.

NOTE: email attachment filenames used are not guaranteed to be unique.

NOTE: by design, multiple file attachment annotations can efficiently refer to the
same embedded file stream in the PDF which provides flexibility for additional reports,
etc. while optimizing for file size.

The PDF File Attachment annotation must contain a *Contents* entry and the file specification
dictionary of the embedded attachment ought to have a meaningful *Desc* entry.
For example, _EA-PDF Creation Software_ may decide to use these entries to assist
in disambiguating email attachments for situations where the filename is not unique
in an EA-PDF file.

NOTE: Reason: The *Contents* key is often used by legacy viewers when navigating
file attachment annotations on a PDF page (such as when hovering over the paperclip
icon of the annotation). The embedded file stream dictionary *Desc* key (description)
is often used when presenting the list of embedded files in a separate navigation
pane. PDF standards do not define this level of user experience. Ensuring both are
present provides a wider and hopefully more reliable legacy viewer experience.

If an attachment exists in the source email but cannot be embedded in the EA-PDF
file, then the file attachment annotation and embedded file stream representing that
attachment ought to be created, with the stream *Length* set to zero bytes.

NOTE: Reason: this simulates the preserved representation of the email will still
appear to have an attachment (via the File attachment annotation linked to a filename)
even in legacy software, even if the bytes of the attachment are excluded from preservation
(e.g., by a policy setting). However, this is not mandated as it cannot be machine
validated without referencing the original source email asset.

When the length of the stream data of the embedded file stream is non-zero, the decompressed
PDF stream data needs to contain the full data of the decompressed email attachment
as present in the original source email asset.

NOTE: PDF embedded file streams can be losslessly compressed to reduce PDF file size.
PDF does not support Base64 as is used by email.

NOTE: Reason: this ensures that the email attachment is faithfully preserved in EA-PDF
by not being processed by the EA-PDF Creation Software which might result in a different
bitstream (e.g. line ending changes). However, this is not mandated as it cannot
be machine validated without referencing the original source email asset.

The embedded file parameter dictionary (<<ISO_32000_2,table=45>>) is required to
have a *ModDate* entry for all associated files. _EA-PDF Writers_ may also wish to
record the MD5 checksum via the *CheckSum* and *Size* entries for all embedded file
streams, which can assist correlating with XMP metadata and detecting any issues
with file extraction.

The embedded file stream dictionary may also contain an *AF* array with a file specification
dictionary having an *AFRelationship* key with a value of _Alternative_ for an alternative
representation of the attachment (e.g., conversion of the email attachment to PDF
or PDF/A). See <<AssociatedFiles>>.

NOTE: EA-PDF permits renderings of email attachments to be included in an EA-PDF
file (e.g. as an embedded PDF/A file or an additional Content Set (set of pages))
even if the attachment itself is not included (zero length). However, these alternate
representations are not ambiguous as the actual email attachment itself because of
the *AFRelationship* value.

The embedded file stream dictionary may also contain a *Metadata* entry. This may
contain metadata that associates the attachment back to an email (i.e., via `Mail_GUID`),
or additional provenance information such as set by the archival policy or captured
by the EA-PDF Creation Software. See <<MetadataStreams>> and <<ISO_32000_2,clause=14.3.2>>.

NOTE: Reason: email attachments may be malicious, corrupted, or zero bytes in length.
EA-PDF desires that a file attachment annotation, file specification dictionary,
and embedded file stream are present for every email file attachment but does not
require that every attachment must be embedded – the embedded file stream may be
zero bytes long. In such cases, a *Metadata* entry might be used to record the reason.
See example below. However, this is not mandated as it cannot be machine validated
without referencing the original source email asset.

[[figure-10]]
.conceptual framework of PDF objects related to email attachments with alternate rendering
image::figure-10.png[]

[NOTE,keep-separate=true]
====
Reason: the LWG wanted to associate the email attachment filename, Media Type
(from email), associated `Message-ID` (of the email, but this may not always be
present hence the need to use `Mail_GUID`), and to support alternative renderings
for non-archival attachment formats. Note that all streams in the above diagram
may be losslessly compressed using *FlateDecode*.
====

The *Subtype* entry of the embedded file stream dictionary must be present and
ought to be set to the IANA Media Type as recorded in the source email (subject
to encoding differences), but excluding any parameters that are present in the
source email. If required, IANA Media Type parameters can be stored as a PDF string
object in the optional *Mail_MediaTypeParameters* entry.

NOTE: Only some IANA Media Types have parameters. RFC 8118 does not define any
IANA Media Type parameters for application/pdf.

NOTE: Reason: some email clients use additional logic beyond just the attachment
Media Type from the source email. To ensure accurate and consistent preservation
and representation, the source email Media Type should reflect the original source
email asset, rather than a different but arbitrarily determined Media Type. However,
this is not mandated as it cannot be machine validated without referencing the
original source email asset.

metadata for `PDF/mail-1{s, si, m, mi}` files. This includes all attachments that
resulted in zero-sized PDF embedded file streams.

NOTE: Reason: this explicit request was from the EA-PDF LWG for an inventory of
attachments and is limited to `PDF/mail-1{s, si, m, mi}` only. It is not relevant
to `PDF/mail-1{c, ci}` files since each `PDF/mail-1{s, si, m, mi}` file in the
container will have its own embedded email attachment count and maintaining aggregated
counts is error-prone.

==== Email attachment example

Consider the following source email fragment where the email attachment "Report.doc"
is detected by the EA-PDF Creation Software to contain content in violation of
an archival policy setting (e.g., malicious VBA macros), but the archival policy
requires an alternate representation for preservation purposes(e.g., conversion to PDF/A):

will need to first decode and then re-compress using a suitable PDF compression
filter such as FLATE (*FlateDecode*).

In the example above, if the source email Media Type was the generic
"application/octet-stream", some email clients might then use additional means
to associate the attachment with an application (possibly by examining the file
extension or file content). EA-PDF _strongly recommends_ avoiding this application-
and machine-specific behavior.

NOTE: this cannot be mandated as it cannot be machine validated without referencing
the original source email asset.

NOTE: the IANA Media Type application/pdf is used for every kind of PDF file –
there is no specific Media Type for PDF, PDF/A or EA-PDF files and there are no
parameters defined. See <<RFC_8118>>.

=== Structured containers (`PDF/mail-1c`)

The LWG recognized that EA-PDF has a requirement to preserve complex hierarchies
of folders containing emails in a single PDF, reflecting emails stored in Microsoft(TM)
OST/PST files or as represented in file systems by other email clients such as
Mozilla Thunderbird using folders with one or more MBOX files. This requirement
is achieved by using PDF Collections (also known as "PDF Portable Collections",
"PDF Portfolios", "PDF Packages" or "PDF Binders") that were introduced with
PDF 1.7 and extended in PDF 2.0 (<<ISO_32000_2,clause=12.3.5>>).

PDF Collections are fully compatible with PDF/A-3 and PDF/A-4f / PDF/A-4e.

NOTE: only some legacy PDF viewers support PDF Collections while those that don't
will often fallback with behavior typically resulting in a list of the embedded
files (e.g., a flat list of files in a file attachment pane without any folder
hierarchy).

Several scenarios have been identified by the LWG:

. Creation of a preservation EA-PDF container from monolithic complex email formats
(such as Microsoft(TM) OST/PST that contains internal folder hierarchies) such
that the PDF reflects the hierarchical folders with emails footnote:[EA-PDF does
not attempt to preserve (as so-called "portable renderings" such as with PDF pages)
other types of items that may be in OST/PST files, such as calendar, contacts,
to-do lists, etc. This data is not prohibited from existing in the embedded source
assets, or to be included in additional content sets but EA-PDF does not define
such details.], as illustrated in the left portion of <<figure-11>> below. In this
scenario, there is typically a [underline]#_single_# original raw source email
asset (e.g., OST/PST) embedded in the container PDF, with `PDF/mail-1{si, mi}`
files used to represent the emails in a folder hierarchy (these PDFs do [underline]#_not_#
contain original raw source email assets and are thus indicated using the "isolated"
profile designator i). If such embedded EA-PDF files are extracted from the container,
then they are [underline]#_isolated_# from their original raw source email asset.
. Packaging of previously created individual EA-PDF files into a "structured container".
The previously created EA-PDF files could be any `PDF/mail` profile, including
other `PDF/mail-1c` files recursively. Use cases included packaging of many EA-PDFs
reflecting an organizational structure as well as reflecting folders of MBOX
(`PDF/mail-1{m, mi}`) or MSG/EML (`PDF/mail-1{s, si}`) files, as illustrated in
the right portion of <<figure-11>> below. This scenario also reflects how Mozilla
Thunderbird stores emails as multiple MBOX files arranged in a folder hierarchy
on a hard disk and where each embedded file in the container has its own embedded
original raw source email asset (i.e., the MBOX file). If such embedded PDF files
are then extracted from the container `PDF/mail-1c` file then they continue to
contain their original raw source email asset and remain as valid preservation
assets (although without the context of their folder hierarchy).
. Packaging of one or more redacted, isolated, or otherwise modified EA-PDF files
into a container for further non-preservation distribution uses, such as via FOIA
requests or access copies. In this case, the container file will be indicated as
`PDF/mail-1ci` as one or more of the original raw source email assets or metadata
has been removed or modified. The container `PDF/mail-1ci` otherwise retains all
other EA-PDF features, except that provenance back to the original raw source email
asset for one or more emails has been lost or compromised.

In an EA-PDF context, the embedded files in the PDF Collection of the right scenario
in <<figure-11>> are described as "isolated" as they meet all EA-PDF requirements
when extracted from the `PDF/mail-1c` file [underline]#_except_# they do not contain
the original raw source email asset. Those in the left scenario remain as valid
standalone `PDF/mail-1{s, m}` files because they [underline]#_include_# their original
raw source email asset even when extracted.

NOTE: EA-PDF preserved emails need to have verifiable provenance back to a preserved
original raw source email asset, whether this be in the embedded file for
`PDF/mail-1{s, m}` or in the container `PDF/mail-1c` file.

There is no requirement that `PDF/mail-1c` files [underline]#_must_# contain hierarchical
folders, although it is expected. There are also no specific requirements imposed
on any internal folder structure or when/how specific profiles of embedded `PDF/mail`
files need to be embedded in `PDF/mail-1c`. Although this provides greater flexibility
and supports multiple EA-PDF scenarios and use-cases, some suggestions and guidance
may be useful:

* If folder preservation is not required, then it is probably better to consider
using `PDF/mail-1m`, as `PDF/mail-1m` will be more widely supported by legacy PDF
viewers than `PDF/mail-1c`, but this is not mandated.
* Any EA-PDF `PDF/mail` profile can be stored in a single container
`PDF/mail-1{c, ci}` file. An embedded `PDF/mail-1{c, ci}` can thus contain other
`PDF/mail-1{c, ci}` files, creating a nesting of files using PDF Collections. Although
permitted, this nesting probably does not create a good end user experience as
each PDF Collection needs to be individually opened to examine its contents.
* Empty folders (i.e., folders without any associated embedded files) are allowed
in PDF Collections, although some non-EA-PDF aware legacy viewers do not display
empty folders.
* As mentioned above, it is preferable to embed multiple `PDF/mail-1m` or `PDF/mail-1s`
files in a folder hierarchy so that it can be completely navigated from the container
`PDF/mail-1c` (like an email client), rather than embed multiple separate `PDF/mail-1c`
files with internal folder hierarchies.
* The folder structure in `PDF/mail-1{c, ci}` is not prescribed. The top-level
folder structure might reflect an organization structure, users, a single user,
different email accounts, or simply folders in a typical desktop email client.
Each folder and sub-folder in the PDF Collection might contain an embedded `PDF/mail-1m`
footnote:[Or, degenerately, a `PDF/mail-1s` if there was just a single email message.
Or no embedded `PDF/mail` file if there are no emails. There is no requirement
that an embedded EA-PDF file exist in every folder.] file with the user's emails,
or multiple `PDF/mail-1s` files if the emails being archived are stored individually
(e.g., as MSG or EML). The use of a `PDF/mail-1{m,mi}` file is likely preferable
as this also allows sharing of resources such as fonts and images, and will reduce
overall file size.
* Using a single `PDF/mail-1{c, ci}` container with hierarchical folders, each
with either a single `PDF/mail-1{m, mi}` or multiple `PDF/mail-1{s, si}` is more
user friendly than nesting `PDF/mail-1c` files with more subfolders, although this
is not prohibited. This is because each nested `PDF/mail-1{c, ci}` will need to
be opened separately to navigate their content. Using individual
`PDF/mail-1{m, mi}` files in each folder is also likely more efficient than embedding
multiple `PDF/mail-1{s, si}` files, although this is not prohibited
footnote:[Note that resources (fonts, images, etc.) inside one embedded `PDF/mail`
file cannot be shared with another embedded `PDF/mail` file. PDF resource reuse
is always limited to within a single PDF.]. Again, the use of a `PDF/mail-1{m,mi}`
file is likely preferable as this also allows sharing of resources such as fonts
and images, and will reduce overall file size.

The Document Catalog dictionary of a `PDF/mail-1{c, ci}` container files will always
have a *Collections* entry.

NOTE: If there was a single source email file (such as OST/PST file) used to create
the `PDF/mail-1c` file, then that OST/PST file will also be listed in the container
PDF *EmbeddedFiles* name tree (as described above). Consequently, it will also
be included in the files making up the PDF Collection. This is intentional as it
will more likely enable extraction of this source email file by end users using
legacy non-EA-PDF aware software, including software that does not support the
PDF 1.7 Collections feature. EA-PDF aware software can recognize such a file from
its Associated File *AFRelationship* value of_ Source _and present it differently.

`PDF/mail-1{c, ci}` files will always contain one or more pages (in at least one
_Content Set_) that are used as the initial document. These pages do [underline]#_not_#
represent the content of email but are front matter or other content or context
related to the entire collection of emails (rather than a single email in the collection).

NOTE: Reason: this ensures that non-EA-PDF aware legacy software does not accidentally
present an email from a `PDF/mail-1{c, ci}` file in a way that might confuse a
user to think that the EA-PDF only contained a single email. The front matter pages
of the container PDF ought to contain content explaining the file is an EA-PDF
structured container file.

For this reason, the Collection dictionary *D* entry (<<ISO_32000_2,table=153>>)
must not be present so that the page(s) of the `PDF/mail-1{c, ci}` will be initially
shown. These pages may contain one or more _Content Sets_ at the discretion of
the _EA-PDF Creation Software_. Each _Content Set_ will have outline entries (bookmarks)
relevant to the content of the container `PDF/mail-1{c, ci}` file as described
above. As noted in <<ISO_32000_2>>, such pages ought to include information that
"… _helps the user understand what is contained in the collection, such as a title
and an introductory paragraph_".

NOTE: Reason: Content Sets in `PDF/mail-1{c, ci}` files are left unconstrained
and might include content to help users understand the context of the email collection,
conversion reports, policy settings, etc.

The Collection dictionary *View* entry must not be _H_.

NOTE: Reason: This ensures that the collection view is not hidden by default.

A Collection Schema dictionary must be defined containing at least the following
fields listed in <<table-05>>. This minimum set of collection schema fields reflects
a minimal set of EA-PDF _Core Fields_ most relevant to human understanding of email
archives, however _EA-PDF Creation Software_ may add additional fields.
See also Example 1 in <<ISO_32000_2,clause=12.3.5.2>> which illustrates the use
of a simple *CollectionSchema* dictionary for email.

[[table-05]]
.Minimum set of Collection Schema entries for `PDF/mail-1{c, ci}`
[cols="a,a",options="header"]
|===
| Core Field | Collection Schema key (_case sensitive_)

| To      | To
| From    | From
| Sent    | Sent
| Subject | Subject
| Cc      | Cc
| Bcc     | Bcc
| Original message size (_in bytes,_ stem:[>= 0]) | Size
| Number of email attachments (_integer,_ stem:[>= 0]) | Attachments

|===

If the Collection dictionary contains a *Navigator* entry (_new in PDF 2.0_,
<<ISO_32000_2,table=156>>), the Navigator dictionary must not have a *SWF* entry.

NOTE: Reason: this prohibits the use of vendor-specific and obsoleted FLASH-based
(SWF) navigators used by Adobe Extension Level 3 with PDF 1.7 as they are unsuited
to the needs of long-term preservation and were not adopted by ISO into ISO 32000-2
(PDF 2.0).

If there is a need to preserve the hierarchical folder structure of a collection
of emails, then Collection hierarchical *Folders* (_new in PDF 2.0,_
<<ISO_32000_2,clause=12.3.5.2>>) must be used.

NOTE: PDF 2.0 standardized the *Folders* entry in the Collection dictionary
(see <<ISO_32000_2,table=153>>) that was initially proposed by Adobe in Adobe Extension
Level 3 to ISO 32000-1:2008. Both PDF/A-3 and PDF/A-4f conformance levels can be
used as collections as folders do not alter the static page appearance of the PDF/A
emails.

NOTE: EA-PDF Writer: GMail's use of labels is implemented via custom email headers
(e.g., "X-GMailLabel") and only simulates folders in browsers and email clients.
EA-PDF Creation Software is free to select whether such a representation needs
to use `PDF/mail-1{c, ci}` hierarchical folders or not.

All folder and filenames used in `PDF/mail-1{c, ci}` files must always conform
to the valid file name restrictions and must be unique after case normalization,
as described below Table 159 in <<ISO_32000_2>>. Conforming EA-PDF aware software
that supports `PDF/mail-1{c, ci}` must not support or allow invalid filenames
footnote:[Conforming EA-PDF software supporting `PDF/mail-1{c, ci}` needs to always
provide a consistent and reliable experience by prohibiting this statement from
ISO 32000-2: "_An interactive PDF processor may choose to support invalid names
or not_".].

Besides the original raw source email asset(s), all the "contained" embedded files
in a `PDF/mail-1{c, ci}` must be other EA-PDF files.

NOTE: Reason: this prohibits the addition of miscellaneous embedded files in the
collection (such as Associated Files), alongside the EA-PDF files representing
the emails in folders, which might cause confusion when using legacy non-EA-PDF
aware software.

Note that if a `PDF/mail-1{c, ci}` file is opened in a non-EA-PDF aware legacy
interactive PDF viewer that does not support PDF Portable Collections, all the
EA-PDF files listed in the *EmbeddedFiles* name-tree may appear with a preceding
"<_xxx_>" before the filename, where _xxx_ is an integer (e.g., <2>Inbox.pdf,
<3>Sent.pdf). This is due to the way PDF internally associates filenames with folders
in PDF Collections and is unavoidable since it facilities a degree of backward
compatibility for software that does not support PDF Collections.

NOTE: this also means that file specification strings associated with embedded
file streams that use *Folders* must not be an absolute filename or contain folder
names, ".." or other path components (see <<ISO_32000_2,clause=7.11.2>>, File specification strings).

=== User navigation

Navigation of EA-PDF files in interactive PDF viewers was established as an important
consideration by the LWG, including in non-EA-PDF aware legacy software. However,
some PDF features supporting interactive viewing may not provide sufficient structure
and context for reliable machine processing by EA-PDF aware software. This section
describes how navigation experiences of EA-PDF files can be optimized.

Note that PDF/A standards do [underline]#_not_# mandate specific behaviors of interactive
PDF viewers.

==== Initial viewing mode

PDF supports features where a PDF file can hint to an interactive viewer the most
appropriate screen layout to be used. Although not always supported, this can provide
a nicer viewing experience for complex files such as EA-PDF.

The Document Catalog *PageMode* entry controls the appearance of interactive PDF
viewers when a PDF file is first opened. It is widely supported by legacy software.
For `PDF/mail-1{s, si}`, the *PageMode* entry is to be _UseOutlines_ or, if the
email has attachments, _UseAttachments_. For `PDF/mail-1{m, mi}`, *PageMode* entry
must be _UseOutlines_. For `PDF/mail-1{c, ci}`, *PageMode* entry needs to be _UseAttachments._

NOTE: Reason: based on the content of each email, the EA-PDF Creation can set the
*PageMode* appropriately for each `PDF/mail-1{s, si}` file. Because
`PDF/mail-1{m, mi}` files contain many emails (and potentially many attachments
with the same filename), navigating by email is the primary use-case. For
`PDF/mail-1{c, ci}` containers, the primary use-case is accessing the embedded
EA-PDF file attachments, even if PDF Collections are not supported.

Viewer preferences (<<ISO_32000_2,clause=12.2>>) is widely supported by some legacy
software and defines aspects of the interactive PDF viewing experience. The Viewer
Preferences *NonFullScreenPageMode* key needs to be _UseOutlines_.

The PDF document information dictionary *Title* or XMP metadata *dc:title* property
are strings that might be displayed in the title bar of legacy viewing applications.
Thus, these values ought to be set appropriately by EA-PDF Creation software.
See also Viewer Preferences *DisplayDocTitle* (<<ISO_32000_2,table=147>>), as a
common alternative is the PDF filename which is unlikely to be a good user experience.
The *DisplayDocTitle* value is mandated in EA-PDF.

==== Bookmarks

Most interactive PDF viewers provide a "Bookmark" or "Outline" pane for easy navigation
commonly associated with headings in documents. PDF document outlines
(<<ISO_32000_2,clause=12.3.3>>) are commonly referred to as "bookmarks" and represent
a hierarchical navigation structure for users.

NOTE: This document does not mandate the *Title* text or formatting
(*C* and *F* entries) for outline items. The *Title* text supports the Unicode
encodings supported by PDF (UTF-16BE and additionally UTF-8 in PDF 2.0 and PDF/A-4).

NOTE: This document does not mandate how each outline item navigates to the appropriate
section in an EA-PDF file (by action, by structure element, by destination). However,
the PDF/A standards define some constraints and will need to be referenced.

All `PDF/mail-1` files will have at least one outline item, with every
_Content Set_ (including each message body) having a related outline item for easy
navigation.

[example]
an empty draft email would have just one outline item to the page with the representation
of the Core Fields, whereas an email with multiple bodies will have multiple outlines
entries to each of the content sets. In the latter case, the outline items may
form a hierarchy (this is not mandated).

NOTE: Reason: Because emails can have multiple bodies, each resulting in a different
number of pages, bookmarks provide a very widely supported user navigation capability
that can link to the first page in each content set and other important destinations
in EA-PDF files (such as the rendering of Core Fields). It is not required that
the Core Fields are always at the top of the first page, although this is conventional
in most email clients – EA-PDF Creation Software is free to choose.

NOTE: EA-PDF Writer: EA-PDF Creation Software is free to generate other PDF page
content sets (such as conversion reports, lists of attachments, a rendering of
all header fields, a text dump of the raw email, policy settings, etc.) in addition
to the message bodies, but it is required to always create an outline item to the
first page of each Content Set that is generated. This can be machine validated.

`PDF/mail-1{m, mi}` files ought to use a hierarchical outline structure with each
outline item at certain level referencing an individual user, email account, etc.
For optimal navigation, large `PDF/mail-1{m, mi}` files ought to collapse the lower-level
outline items, so that only the outlines items representing each email are visible
on initial viewing.

NOTE: Reason: because `PDF/mail-1{m, mi}` files can contain many emails (potentially
each with multiple message bodies and additional content sets), a fully expanded
outline might result in a poor navigation experience with lots of vertical scrolling
of the outline tree since each email could have multiple child outline items.

==== Embedded files

Many interactive PDF viewers provide a dedicated "File Attachment" or
"Embedded Files" pane providing a list of certain files that are embedded in the
PDF document. Other viewers may include file attachments in their comment pane.
Because emails and EA-PDF use many embedded files this is an important feature
when selecting non-EA-PDF aware legacy interactive PDF viewers.

All files specification dictionaries need to have an appropriate *Desc* entry.

=== Modification workflows

As discussed in the LWG meetings, editing, or modifying EA-PDF files after creation
can damage their preservation integrity, which has serious implications for certain
workflows:

* An EA-PDF file must always pass validation according to its declared PDF/A conformance
level;
* Like PDF ISO subsets, EA-PDF files declare their conformance via the document-level
XMP Metadata from the Document Catalog *Metadata* entry. Such data may not be maintained
by non-EA-PDF aware legacy editing software and thus EA-PDF aware software may
wish to perform additional validation checks at runtime (_this is not mandated!_).

NOTE: by making all EA-PDF profiles PDF/A compliant, some non-EA-PDF aware legacy
software may detect the PDF/A conformance and help to reduce accidental edits to
EA-PDF files. But this is not foolproof!

* Non-isolated EA-PDF files must always have direct provenance to an identifiable
embedded original raw source email asset(s). Either this will be in the `PDF/mail`
file itself (as the Document Catalog Associated Files with an *AFRelationship*
value of _Source_), or in the immediate container `PDF/mail-1c` file (e.g., for
monolithic complex OST/PST files). If there is no such traceable linkage to an
original raw source email asset (e.g., an embedded `PDF/mail` file in a `PDF/mail-1c`
created from a monolithic complex OST/PST that has been extracted) then that extracted
file must be indicated as an "isolated" EA-PDF profile as it has lost its provenance
to its original raw source email asset.
* Although out of scope for EA-PDF, a redacted `PDF/mail` file can no longer be
considered as a trustworthy EA-PDF preservation artifact as it is no longer a faithful
rendition of a verifiable preservation of the original raw source email asset –
but it might still be PDF/A (subject to the PDF redaction software).

NOTE: Reason: redacting only the PDF content but leaving the unredacted embedded
original raw source email asset makes no sense – or vice-versa. Redaction can involve
anything, including the need to alter one or more embedded files, so this keeps
non-isolated EA-PDF files as a clearly demarcated preservation format, while isolated
EA-PDF files continue to provide email archival context. Redaction of email is
beyond the scope of EA-PDF.

This specification does not define email archival workflows.
