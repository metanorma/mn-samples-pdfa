.Foreword

In most cases metadata is all about interoperability: It is only useful if
creator and processor agree on syntax and semantics. In the context of PDF this
also means that creator and processor must agree on where metadata is present in
the often-complex internal PDF structure.

Metadata locations are well defined for XMP metadata on the PDF document level
and for some PDF objects, but not for all objects where metadata can occur (e.g.
pages, page level objects and resources such as fonts or ICC profiles). However,
in almost all cases sufficient guidance can be derived from the PDF
specification, albeit sometimes in an indirect way.

The principal authors of this document are Boris Doubrov (Dual Lab) and Dietrich
von Seggern (callas software).
