.Foreword

This document provides guidance and recommendations for application developers
who want to create PDF files that conform to more than one ISO-standardized
subset of PDF, specifically PDF/A (ISO 19005) and PDF/UA (ISO 14289). This
guidance applies to developers using either PDF 1.7 or PDF 2.0.

This document is informative -- it does not change the meaning of ISO standards.
When in doubt, consult the text of the respective ISO standard(s).

== Terms and definitions


== Background

Modern regulations increasingly specify requirements for accessible documents.
Consequently, many applications add PDF/UA support to existing PDF/A output
capabilities. These existing capabilities may have been implemented many years
ago based on references to old PDF specifications that lack guidance on modern
features. For example, PDF/A-1 doesn't allow transparency, a basic feature of
modern documents. This, and other limitations, prompted the development of
PDF/A-2 and PDF/A-3, which are based on the ISO standard for PDF 1.7 (
<<ISO_32000-1_2008>>).

The advent of PDF 2.0 (<<ISO_32000-2_2020>>) and its "companion" subsets, PDF/A-4
(archival) and PDF/UA-2 (accessibility), has raised the need for industry
guidance on using PDF/A and PDF/UA together.

== Compatibility guide

The following table summarises the PDF Association's compatibility
recommendations for the various editions of PDF/A and PDF/UA. The rest of the
document provides technical details and additional guidance.

== Reference specification

Regardless of the PDF version targeted, any PDF development effort should refer
to <<ISO_32000-2_2020>> (PDF 2.0). This document,
https://pdfa.org/sponsored-standards/[available at no cost], corrects
long-standing errors and resolves many ambiguities in the specification of PDF
1.7 and earlier features while keeping track of the differences between PDF 2.0
and earlier versions.


== Technical details

Application software should specify either PDF 1.7 or PDF 2.0 as the version in
output files. PDF 2.0 is required if PDF 2.0-specific features (as defined by
ISO 32000-2:2020) or PDF 2.0 extensions (as defined by various ISO Technical
Specifications) are used.

* WHY: Helps simplify application output code that creates PDFs, as PDF 1.7
includes features defined in earlier PDF 1.x versions. By versioning as PDF 1.7,
developers can generally avoid implementing additional complex logic to
correctly juggle included feature sets and PDF versions for each specific PDF
file.

* WHY: Assists end-users using outdated software since such software should warn
users when encountering documents with unsupported PDF versions (such warnings
are not guaranteed!). This helps avoid situations where outdated PDF software or
assistive technology (AT) might incorrectly process a document because of a
newer PDF version or feature mismatch.

The only defined mechanism by which all PDF files indicate conformance to PDF/A
and PDF/UA is via the document catalog's XMP Metadata key.

* DETAIL: A single PDF may declare conformance to multiple ISO PDF subset
standards; however, some combinations are invalid. Even for valid combinations,
some software may become confused when encountering multiple conformance claims
or may not consistently report these claims to users.

* DETAIL: PDF/A-1, PDF/A-2, and PDF/A-3 require the inclusion of XMP Extension
Schema for the additional metadata required in documents that conform to any
other ISO-standardized subset of PDF (such as PDF/UA-1). This requires adding an
XMP Extension Schema defining the XMP metadata fields identifying PDF/UA-1
conformance. The PDF Association publishes a free
https://pdfa.org/resource/xmp-extension-schema-templates/#iso[PDF/UA-1 XMP Extension Schema]
that can be included in PDF/A-1, PDF/A-2, and PDF/A-3 files to meet this
requirement.

Combining PDF/A-1 and PDF/UA-1 is NOT RECOMMENDED.

* WHY: PDF/A-1 (ISO 19005-1:2005) is based on an older specification (Adobe's
PDF 1.4), which significantly predates ISO 32000-1:2008, the ISO-standardized
PDF 1.7, which is the basis for PDF/UA-1 (ISO 14289-1:2014).

When creating PDF/UA-1 files, the PDF Association RECOMMENDS using PDF/A-2 or
PDF/A-3, but not PDF/A-1.

* WHY: PDF/A-2 and PDF/A-3 include all of the preservation capabilities defined
in PDF/A-1, and like PDF/UA-1, are based on the ISO standard for PDF 1.7.
PDF/A-3 includes additional capabilities beyond PDF/A-2 related to embedding
(attaching) non-PDF documents.

* DETAIL: When PDF/UA-1 is used with PDF/A-2 or PDF/A-3, an
https://pdfa.org/resource/xmp-extension-schema-templates/[XMP Extension Schema]
for PDF/UA-1 metadata must be included.

* DETAIL: The PDF Association RECOMMENDS using PDF/A conformance Level A for
documents that comply with both PDF/UA-1 and PDF/A-2 or PDF/A-3 to accommodate
workflows that use conformance level A for classification purposes.

* WHY: PDF/UA-1 requires certain PDF features that were introduced after PDF
1.4. Thus, by ensuring PDF/UA-1 documents are always versioned as PDF 1.7, PDF
software (and other downstream software, such as assistive technology) is
thereby prompted to expect such features and can warn users
appropriately if the software only supports earlier PDF versions.

* DETAIL: PDF/A-3 requires conforming software to also support PDF/A-1 and
PDF/A-2.

PDF 1.x documents must NOT use PDF/UA-2 or PDF/A-4.

* WHY: Claiming conformance to PDF/UA-2 or PDF/A-4 is invalid for PDF 1.x
documents, as these ISO- standardized subsets of PDF are designed exclusively
for PDF 2.0. Validators are obliged to fail such documents.

PDF 2.0 documents must NOT use PDF/UA-1 or PDF/A-1, PDF/A-2, and PDF/A-3

* WHY: Subsets of PDF that are based on PDF 1.7 are inapplicable to PDF 2.0,
which includes new features. Instead, PDF 2.0 documents can comply with PDF/UA-2
and/or PDF/A-4. Validators are obliged to fail PDF 2.0 documents that claim
conformance to PDF 1.x based standards,

* DETAIL: PDF 2.0 documents may use the PDF 1.7 standard structure tag set when
conforming to PDF/UA-2.

* DETAIL: Due to PDF/A-4's relaxed provisions regarding XMP metadata, if a
PDF/UA-2 document also conforms to PDF/A-4, an XMP extension schema for PDF/UA-2
is not required. Instead, PDF/A-4 documents may include RELAX-NG schema (see
https://pdfa.org/resource/iso-16684-2/[ISO 16684-2]) as an Associated File of
metadata streams.

PDF 2.0 documents must only use PDF/UA-2 and / or PDF/A-4

NOTE: For guidance on how to ensure PDF/UA-2 conformance while also ensuring
optimal content reuse in PDF 2.0, refer to the PDF Association's
"https://pdfa.org/wtpdf[Well-Tagged PDF Specification]".

Ensure that the PDF version is appropriate to the features included in the PDF
file.


* WHY: A mismatched PDF version and feature set (where the PDF version is too
low) may confuse the end-user experience with certain software or AT.

* DETAIL: For PDF/UA-1, the PDF Association RECOMMENDS always using PDF 1.7.

* DETAIL: For PDF/A-1, the PDF Association RECOMMENDS using PDF 1.4 and NOT
declaring conformance to PDF/UA-1 as PDF/UA-1 files commonly include features
not defined in PDF 1.4.

* DETAIL: For PDF/A-2 and PDF/A-3, the PDF Association RECOMMENDS always using
PDF 1.7. Some validation software (e.g., those based on the
https://pdfa.org/resource/arlington-pdf-model/[Arlington PDF Model])
can verify PDF versions and feature sets in detail. Always use up-to-date PDF
validation software.

* WHY: Out-of-date validation software lacks the latest industry-agreed
clarifications arising from discussions within the PDF Association's technical
working groups.

* WHY: Some validators may only check a single ISO-standardized subset of PDF at
a time, so be sure that all declared conformance statements are individually
validated.

PDF/A (all parts) and PDF/UA-1 define the concept of a "conforming viewer" or
"conforming processor". Thus, each standard defines its own requirements for
software needed to support these ISO-standardized subsets of PDF.

NOTE: Use the appropriate conforming software for the use case to ensure a
correct (conforming) experience.

When validating documents, ensure that results include all conformance
statements in the file.

* WHY: Some validation software checks only a single standard at a time and may
need to be manually configured or run multiple times to validate each
conformance claim.

* WHY: Conforming PDF files can always be used with generic (non-conforming) PDF
software, but the user's experience may not include complete and correct support
for all features required of a conforming viewer by the applicable ISO
standard(s).

Use appropriate software for assurance of appropriate performance.

* WHY: For PDF/A documents, using generic non-conforming PDF/A software may
result in pages that look (render) differently and do not accurately reflect the
document's content.

* WHY: For PDF/UA documents, using generic PDF software may result in a partial
or complete failure to deliver the document's content in an accessible manner
(e.g., text being read in an incorrect order).

Some PDF viewers and application software may not inform the user when
encountering a document that conforms to multiple ISO PDF subset standards.

* WHY: Some PDF viewers and applications may be incapable of displaying all
conformance statements present in the file, while other PDF viewers may not
process XMP metadata at all. This behavior does not impact the document's
conformance but may impact its display or available interactions.

* CONTEXT: Such behaviors are due to the limitations of specific software
implementations and do not impact the document's conformance. Contact your
vendor for more information.

Some PDF viewers and application software may not correctly process or report
the PDF file's version number.

* DETAIL: The version of a PDF file is determined by examining *_both_* the file
header (ISO 32000, §7.5.2) *_and_* the *Version* entry (if any) in the document
catalog (ISO 32000, §7.7.2). However, outdated or unmaintained software may
incorrectly ignore the *Version* entry, which was added to Adobe's PDF Reference
1.4 in 2001.

Some PDF viewers and application software may not yet support PDF 2.0 and thus cannot
function as conforming processors for PDF/A-4 or PDF/UA-2.

NOTE: PDF Association members can indicate on the
https://pdfa.org/support-for-pdf-features-and-subsets/[Feature Support page]
if their software supports PDF/UA-2 or PDF 2.0. Otherwise, check with your
vendor to see if their software is compatible with PDF 2.0, PDF/A-4, or
PDF/UA-2.
