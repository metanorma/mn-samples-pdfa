== Editing tagged PDF files

Consideration is due when merging PDF documents with different language settings, metadata, or other features.  

Deleting pages, splitting documents, inserting pages and similar operations require that structure elements (as well as bookmarks or internal link destinations) connected with page content objects  be handled appropriately. 

When inserting pages into a tagged PDF document, care must be taken to reconcile the structure elements associated with the inserted pages with that of the target document. 

It is semantically appropriate to have the deletion of content result in the deletion of corresponding structure elements.
