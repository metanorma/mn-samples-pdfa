[[SE_List]]
==== `<L>` (List), `<LI>` (List Item), `<LBody>` (List Body)

The `<L>` (list) structure element encloses a sequence of one or more content items with `<LI>` structure elements enclosing each content item. <<SE_Lbl,`<Lbl>`>> encloses the list item marker for each content item, while `<LBody>` encloses the content item's content.

For PDF 1.7 (and thus, PDF/UA-1) requires that if present, a list's caption is enclosed in a <<SE_Caption,`<Caption>`>> structure element and precedes the `<LI>` structure elements within the captioned `<L>`.

===== Examples

.A simple list
[source,taggedpdf]
----
<L> {
   <Caption>
   <LI>
   <LI> {
      <Lbl>
      <LBody>
   }
}

Although a canonical form can be derived from <<ISO_32000_1>>, the specification does not prohibit other parent-child relationships between the various standard structure elements in a list. As a result, it is recommended that processors be able to handle various forms of lists, including cases in which a `<LBody>` encapsulates another list that is structurally unrelated to the `<LBody>`'s parent `<L>`. Examples of acceptable list structures follow.

<L> {
   <LI> {
      <Lbl>
      <LBody>
   }
   <LI> {
      <Lbl>
      <LBody>
   }
   <L> {
      <LI> {
         <Lbl>
         <LBody>
      }
      <LI> {
         <Lbl>
         <LBody>
      }
      <LI> {
         <Lbl>

This model (multilevel list) is borrowed from HTML.

.A list containing another, semantically unrelated list
[example]
====

In this example the two `<L>` structure elements represent independent structures.

<L> {
   <LI> {
      <Lbl>
      <LBody>
   }
   <LI> {
      <Lbl>
      <LBody> {
         <P>
         <P>
         <L> {
            <LI> {
               <Lbl>
               <LBody>
            }
            <LI> {
               <Lbl>
               <LBody>
            }
         }
         <P>
      }
   }
   <LI> {
      <Lbl>
      <LBody>
   }
}

===== Creation

For each content item that has a list item marker -- such as a bullet or list-numbering -- semantic appropriateness requires that the list item marker is enclosed in a <<SE_Lbl,`<Lbl>`>> structure element.

Semantic appropriateness requires that, apart from the list-item's label itself, the semantic content of each list item be enclosed in an `<LBody>` structure element, including inline content or arbitrary complex structures.

===== Consumption

It is recommended that processors expect to encounter real content as the direct child of an `<LI>` structure element. In such cases, it is recommended that processors treat such content as if it were enclosed in an `<LBody>` structure element.
