[[SE_Code]]
==== `<Code>`

Intended to semantically identify code examples, this structure element serves to indicate that enclosed content would preferably be represented precisely; without further modification (for example: justification, cleanup of white space). However, use of this structure element does not imply that extraction would result in usable code.

Support for this structure element by AT is not anticipated.
