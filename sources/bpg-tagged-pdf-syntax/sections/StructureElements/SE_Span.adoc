[[SE_Span]]
==== `<Span>`

The primary purpose of `<Span>` is to demarcate content for the purpose of applying semantic and other attributes. Although the `<Span>` structure element type itself has no inherent semantics, semantic information is provided by attributes employed on a given instance of a `<Span>` structure element type.

<Span> can serve in many capacities but is most useful for subdividing smaller regions of content, such as words within a <<SE_P,`<P>`>>. `<Span>` may be used as a vehicle for language (*Lang*), replacement content (*ActualText*), alternate description (*Alt*) and expansion (*E*) attributes, and various presentational, layout and other attributes documented in <<ISO_32000_1, clause="14.8.5.4 Layout Attributes">>.
