[[SE_Quote]]
==== `<Quote>`

`<Quote>` encloses quoted content within a paragraph (inline element). See also <<SE_BlockQuote,`<BlockQuote>`>> a block-level element that encloses longer portions of quoted content.

===== Examples

.A quote within a paragraph
[source,taggedpdf]
----
<P> { some text {
   <Quote> {quoted text}
   }
   more text
}
----

===== Creation

Where quoted content exists inside a paragraph or other block-level structure element, the `<Quote>` structure element is used.

Where quoted content does not exist inside a paragraph or other block-level structure element, the <<SE_BlockQuote,`<BlockQuote>`>> structure element is used.

===== Consumption

It is recommended to present quoted content such that a consumer can distinguish between quoted and unquoted content.

For example, text-to-speech (TTS) could use voicing changes or beeps to indicate a quote, whereas a visual presentation using text extraction / reflow may benefit from a text styling change.
